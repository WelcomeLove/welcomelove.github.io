    <p>Dear friends, crypto enthusiasts, unfortunately, now is a bad time to discuss crypto coins, so I, like other adequate people, write on bitcointalk about the war in Ukraine, my native country, which I love very much!</p>
    <img src="2c.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <>I know that  Ukraine will win and be a free country!</p>
    <img src="1d.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Regarding the above post, I want to say: Based on experience, I can say that you do not need special skill in managing a charitable foundation to help your city, but need the desire of some people to help other people who are in terrible trouble!</p>
    <img src="1a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Thank God!</p> 
    <img src="3a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>There are many merciful people in the World doing God's pleasing deeds!</p>
   <img src="22b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400"> 
      <p>Not indifferent people of the planet, want to save the lives of Ukrainian people!</p>
    <img src="2a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>One only needs to say to these wonderful people how they can help the Ukrainians!</p> 
      <p>Good people, not standing aside from the war, donate their funds and call through social networks to donate to the Ukrainians!</p>
    <img src="5a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>People know that civilians in Ukraine are being shot, shelled, bombed, their houses are on fire, they and their children are bleeding!</p>
    <img src="15a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Those people who themselves donate funds do not ask to publish reports, photos of the work done or checks!</p>
    <img src="11a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>People provide help at the behest of their Heart, expressing their sympathy for the Ukrainians, do not demand anything in return!</p>

      <p>The collected cryptocurrency by the State Funds is connected to the conversion process of the FTX and KUNA exchanges.</p> 
      <p>The exchange converts cryptocurrency into fiat, dollar or UAH and sends it to the accounts of the Ministry of Digital Development or the National Bank of Ukraine.</p> 
      <p>But, many people in the World, doubting the effectiveness of their help, because of the negative image of corrupt officials in Ukraine!</p>
    <img src="16a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>In support of the above, here is a quote: I am sure that the Ukrainian government is corrupt and oppressed many people within its borders for various reasons, by the way, 
      so I would not donate to their official BTC addresses or anything like that post</p> <p>"original link"<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382794.msg59474469#msg59474469">CLICK</a>.</p> 
      <p>Therefore, many people prefer to provide charitable assistance not to large, impersonal, official state funds, but through ordinary people's volunteers, relatives or ordinary caring people on the ground there are more and more people like this every day!</p> 
      <p>People want to help a particular city/region or even individually a person, a family, a community.</p>
    <img src="17a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Concerning the fears spread by about massive fundraising scams!</p>
      <p>I will say this: against the general background of volunteers and good people they do not have a significant impact on the desire of good people to help other good people!</p> 
    <img src="10a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Most people who help are very reasonable! Comparing the risks between fraudulent fundraising and saving people's lives, people unambiguously choose to help Ukrainians!</p>
    <img src="8a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>After all, even a little help can save someone a big life!</p>
    <img src="4b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>At a minimum, doing good deeds, people put a huge plus on their Karma!</p>
    <img src="1b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>In other words, our deeds ripen according to the principle “what we sow, we will reap” 
      good deeds will respond with good, evil ones will turn into evil!</p>
    <img src="18a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">    
      <p>I think who wants to help he will help, and who does not want will find a reason to refuse!</p>
    <img src="19a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Dear friends, if I have not convinced YOU of the need to provide assistance to Ukrainians, at least in an amount that does not cause tangible damage to personal well-being, then my further convictions lose their meaning!</p>

      <p>Dear franky1!</p>
    <img src="9c.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>You asked if there are any local businesses that deliver in an area that accepts bitcoin.</p> 
      <p>And I mean legitimate businesses. (not fake phishing sites created last month) through which people can just buy things on a website where you can host some legitimate shelters/clearing points, physical addresses of hospitals (legitimate charities), etc. and use the delivery address of the shelter / hospital as the destination of the goods, so that they can then be delivered directly to the shelters/hospitals.</p>  
    <img src="22a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Dear franky1!</p>
      <p>As for "non-fake phishing sites created last month" I will say this phishing was relevant for peacetime and reasoning over a cup of coffee under a sky without bombs!</p> 
      <p>In war, other criteria of truth work!</p>
    <img src="12a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Ukraine did not believe that russia would attack, but the treacherous attack happened!</p>
    <img src="9b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400"><br
      <p>Of course there are new sites for collecting donations!</p>
    <img src="23a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>New sites for fundraising will appear: yesterday, today, tomorrow and every new day, and this is good for Ukrainians and Victory of the whole Friendly World!</p>
    <img src="10b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>This does not mean at all that these sites are phishing!</p>
    <img src="24a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>It rather means that more good people want to help other good people!</p>
    <img src="7a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400"> 
      <p>What are the benefits of cryptocurrencies for donations?</p>
    <img src="4c.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Cryptocurrency is not a replacement for traditional donations “it’s an additional fundraising tool”.</p>
    <img src="11d.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>For volunteers who collect donations for the army, this is important, because some financial organizations equate their activities with "support for violence."</p>
    <img src="12d.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>For example, on the first day of russia’s invasion of Ukraine, February 24, fundraising platform Ptatreon removed the page of the Turn Back Alive foundation, explaining that it “does not allow the funds raised on the platform to be used to support violence or purchase military equipment.”<br>  
    <img src="14d.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400"><br>
      Compared to bank transfers, it has several advantages It's fast and easy.<br>
    <img src="15d.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400"><br>
      Organizations do not need to spend time opening a bank account and verifying; transfers are made almost instantly, unlike SWIFT transactions, which can take several days. According to Mr.Chobanyan (owner of the Ukrainian exchange KUNA), even if the banking system goes out, people know how to convert cryptocurrency into cash and vice versa.</p>
    <img src="15d.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">  
      <p>So, thanks to the crypt, it will be possible to buy everything you need during the War.</p> 
      <p>Ukrainians saw cryptocurrency as an alternative to public and private financial institutions, which are not trusted in wartime due to the threat of losing funds.</p>  
    <img src="25a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
    <img src="26a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Evacuated Ukrainians can transfer funds to crypto, so that later they can safely convert it back to fiat currency already abroad, not risking losing significant mounts due to a depreciation</p>

      <p>My "step by step" life hack for people who want to help Ukrainians, but do not trust corrupt officials, volunteers and just caring people in Ukraine!</p>
    <img src="12b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>You must learn to choose people who need help immediately (for example medicines)!</p> 
      <p>Also, you need to learn military logistics so that effectively provide assistance!</p>
      <p>Of course, without knowing the local, military situation, technical and logistical capabilities, this is not easy!</p>
      <p>I mustwarn you that in cities that are under siege, destroyed or captured, the chances are minimal, but you have to try (you will learn from correspondence with a person).</p>  
      <p>Therefore, I initially recommended starting cooperation with state funds, and if you do not trust officials, then cooperate with local volunteers or caring people on the ground!</p>
      <p>But, I believe that you will learn how to effectively save people without being directly in Ukraine!</p>
      <p>The most important thing is to help the Ukrainian army and people, to defeat the Devil!</p>
      <p>Here is my "step by step" life hack for people who want to help Ukrainians, but do not trust corrupt officials, volunteers and just caring people in Ukraine</p>
    <img src="11c.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <h2>Option Basic Step By Step</h2>  
       <p>1. Register your account on the Ukrainian crypto currency exchange (you can use Binance, but there are fewer payment options in UAH)</p>
          <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://kuna.io">CLICK</a>.</p>  
       <p>2. Replenish your exchange account with cryptocurrencies (any from the list of the exchange).</p>
       <p>3. Exchange your crypto coins for UAH!</p> 
       <p>4. Find a city, a community and select the people you want to help or offer your help.</p> 
          <p>For example here</p> 
          <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://ukrainenews.fakty.ua/ru/397671-tem-kto-nuzhdaetsya-v-pomocshi-adresa-volonterskih-telegramm-kanalov">CLICK</a>.</p>
          <p>+ example this</p> 
          <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/YWL1i8NGX5NhM2My">CLICK</a>.</p>  
          <p>Example a person needs medicament, but he was left without money and his house.</p> 
          </>Ask this person: price, quantity, where you can buy medicine and what payment methods are available (KUNA has 4 options in hryvnias + crypto, allowed in Ukraine).</p>
       <p>5. Pay for the medicine and tell the Order number to the person!</p> 
        <p>Everything! You My Hero!</p>
     <img src="27a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
       <h2>Light option Step-By-Step </h2>
       <p>1. Find a chat group in social networks of a particular city and select the people you want to help or tell them that you want to help.</p> 
       <p>2. Ask a person how much money he needs and for what exactly (better focus on critical positions for life, but this is not necessary)!</p>
       <p>3. Tell the person that you can donate the equivalent of the amount in cryptocurrency, but you need his crypto wallet (agree on the name of the coin).</p> 
       <p>4. After, transfer coins to the person!</p>
      <p>The person himself will find where to exchange and buy what he needs! (via: stock exchange, bank, private exchanger)!</p> 
      <p>Everything! You my hero!</p>
    <img src="28a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Unfortunately there is one problem! Very often, people in need do not have a crypto account and do not know how to make it and how it works!</p>
      <p>Need to explain and teach! Otherwise, they have to turn to outside help for help!</p>
      <p>And if you are not in the crypto topic, then there are simply no such people in your environment!</p>
    <img src="29a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Dear Franky1, you can create your own charitable mini-fund and collect donations for Ukrainians from your relatives, friends, acquaintances and local urban communities.</p>
    <img src="30a.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">  
      <p>Here are some recommendations!</p>
      <p>For each community (Instagram, Facebook, Reedit, Twitter, LinkedIn and others) it is better to create separate crypto wallets!</p>
      <p>Then, you will know how many merciful people there are in this social network!</p>
      <p>With low responsiveness, draw the appropriate conclusion!</p>
      <p>Do not waste time and the fire of your Soul on people without compassion!</p>
    <img src="15b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Conversely, with positive people you will do a lot of good deeds!</p>
    <img src="16b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>Dear Franky1 and other merciful people, if you want to provide only one-time assistance, then it is better, easier, more reliable and more efficient to provide your assistance through official state funds or volunteers!</p>
   <img src="12c.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>So, Franky1, if you want to help Ukrainians on your own, you have my instructions!</p>
   <img src="17b.png" alt="UKRAINE IN WAR" width="400" height="400">
      <p>If you want to help through the official state fund of Ukraine, use my links to them!</p>
