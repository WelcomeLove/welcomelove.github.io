<p>sexual assault/statutory rape/gang rape/child abuse/genocide/brutal murder/robbery/criminal assault/</p>
<p>WARNING: Some texts detail sexual abuse.</p>
<p>I will warn you right away, if you are pregnant or have problems with perception, it is better not to read any further.</p>
<img src="image txt/057.jpg">
<p>There is a certain mysticism in the fact that by declaring itself the successor of the USSR, Russia has adopted from this totalitarian country all the worst.</p> 
<p>Both in general and in detail.</p>
<p>It's no secret now that mass rape was a part of the Soviet troops' victorious march across Western Europe during World War II.</p>
<p>Soviet soldiers raped countless women, teenagers and even children all along their victorious procession through Europe, not just in Germany.</p>
<p>For years, the topic was taboo.</p> 
<p>Not much was said about it, even in Germany itself.</p> 
<p>But the fact remains.</p> 
<p>No one was held accountable for this, moreover, the victims of violence were not allowed to call their abusers to account or even just to talk about their misfortune.</p>
<p>Why are we talking about this now? The answer is obvious.</p>
<p>The Russian army during a large-scale invasion of Ukraine behaves in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>Occasionally there is talk that the goal of the Red Army is to annihilate the German people.</p>
<p>The goal of Putin's Army is to destroy the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>In reality, rape of German women was implicitly condoned by Stalin.</p>
<img src="image txt/067.jpg">      
<p>Judging by the intercepts of telephone conversations of the Russian military, Putin is doing the same.</p>
<p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, then a young captain in the Red Army, describes the entry of his regiment into East Prussia in January 1945:</p>
<p>“For three weeks the war had been going on inside Germany, and all of us knew very well that if the girls were German they could be raped and then shot.</p> 
<p>This was almost a combat a task.”</p>
<p>Solzhenitsyn was a committed opponent of such atrocities and vocally opposed the rape of German women.</p> 
<p>As a consequence, he was arrested and banished to a “Gulag”.</p>
<p>Many of Soviet first echelon troops were more concerned with fighting and survival than with rape.</p> 
<p>However, most of the second echelon of Soviet troops were from Asiatic Russia and brought with them attitudes toward conquered people inherited from Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>The comparison with the Russian troops in Ukraine involuntarily suggests itself.</p> 
<p>It is people from the same Russian territories who show particular atrocities against Ukrainian women.</p>
<p>The savagery of Soviet soldiers was acknowledged by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in his Memoirs.</p>
<img src="image txt/115.jpg">      
<p>Montgomery states: “From their behaviour it soon became clear that the Russians, though a fine fighting race, were in fact barbarous Asiatics who had never enjoyed a civilization comparable to that of the rest of Europe.</p> 
<p>Their approach to every problem was utterly different from ours and their behaviour, especially in their treatment of women, was abhorrent to us.”</p>
<p>Russian soldiers continually raped German women as the Red Army advanced through Silesia and Pomerania towards Berlin.</p> 
<p>The German women were frequently ganged raped, often again and again on successive nights.</p> 
<p>A woman interviewed in Schwerin reported that she had “already been raped by ten men today.”</p> 
<p>A German officer in East Prussia claims to have saved a few dozen women from a villa where “on average they had been raped 60 to 70 times a day.”</p> 
<p>Another woman in Berlin stated: “Twenty-three soldiers one after the other. I had to be stitched up in a hospital.</p> 
<p>I never want to have anything to do with any man again.”</p>
<p>Churches were frequently used by Russian soldiers to rape German women.</p> 
<p>A priest from Neisse reports:</p>
<p>The girls, women and nuns were raped incessantly for hours on end, the soldiers standing in queues, the officers at the head of the queues, in front of their victims.</p> 
<p>During the first night many of the nuns and women were raped as many as fifty times.</p> 
<p>Some of the nuns who resisted with all their strength were shot, others were ill-treated in a dreadful manner until they were too exhausted to offer any resistance.</p>
<img src="image txt/111.jpg">      
<p>The Russians knocked them down, kicked them, beat them on the head and in the face with the butt-end of their revolvers and rifles, until they finally collapsed and in this unconscious condition became the helpless victims of brutish passion, which was so inhuman as to be inconceivable.</p> 
<p>The same dreadful scenes were enacted in the hospitals, homes for the aged, and other such institutions.</p> 
<p>Even nuns who were seventy and eighty years old and were ill and bedridden were raped and ill-treated by these barbarians.</p>
<p>When Russian soldiers “liberated” Danzig they promptly liberated all the women of their virtue and chastity.</p> 
<p>A Russian soldier told the Danzig women to seek shelter in the Catholic cathedral to protect them from the rapes.</p> 
<p>After hundreds of women and girls were securely inside, the Russian soldiers entered and “playing the organ and ringing the bells, kept up a foul orgy through the night, raping all the women, some more than 30 times.”</p> 
<p>A Catholic pastor in Danzig states, “They even violated eight-year-old girls and shot boys who tried to shield their mothers.”</p>
<p>The following is part of an eyewitness account written by a veteran American newspaperman.</p> 
<p>He had been taken prisoner by the Germans in Paris and later freed by the Russians with whom he traveled as they swept over eastern Germany to Berlin and beyond:</p>
<p>In the district around our internment camp—the territory comprising the towns of Schlawe, Lauenburg, and Buckow and hundreds of larger villages—Red soldiers during the first weeks of their occupation raped every woman and girl between the ages of 12 and 60.</p> 
<p>That sounds exaggerated but it is the simple truth.</p>
<p>The only exceptions were girls who managed to remain in hiding in the woods or who had the presence of mind to feign illness—typhoid, dyptheria or some other infectious disease.</p>
<img src="image txt/072.jpg">
<p>Flushed with victory—and often with wine found in the cellars of rich Pomeranian land owners—the Reds searched every house for women, cowing them with pistols or tommy guns, and carried them into their tanks or trucks.</p>
<p>Husbands and fathers who attempted to protect their women folk were shot down and girls offering extreme resistance were murdered.</p>
<p>Some weeks after the invasion, Red “political commissions” began a tour of the countryside ostensibly in search of members of the Nazi party.</p> 
<p>In every village the women were told to report for examination of papers to these commissions, which looked them over and detained those with sex appeal.</p> 
<p>The youngest and prettiest were taken by the officers and the rest left to the mercy of the privates.</p>
<p>This reign of terror lasted as long as I was with the Reds in Pomerania.</p> 
<p>Several girls whom I had known during my captivity committed suicide.</p> 
<p>Others died after having been raped by ten soldiers in succession….</p>
<p>When a German counterattack temporarily recaptured the town of Neustettin, a German soldier describes what he saw in houses where Russian soldiers had raped German women:</p>
<p>Naked, dead women lay in many of the rooms. Swastikas had been cut into their abdomens…[too graphic, in Ukraine, the Russian invaders are doing the same], faces beaten to a pulp and swollen puffy.</p> 
<p>Others had been tied to the furniture by their hands and feet, and massacred…</p>
<p>The mothers had had to witness how their 10 and 12-year-old daughters were raped by some 20 men; the daughters in turn saw their mothers being raped, even their grandmothers.</p>
<img src="image txt/069.jpg">
<p>Women who tried to resist were brutally tortured to death.</p> 
<p>There was no mercy….</p>
<p>The women we liberated were in a state almost impossible to describe….</p> 
<p>Their faces had a confused, vacant look.</p> 
<p>Some were beyond speaking to, ran up and down and said the same sentences over and over again.</p> 
<p>Having seen the consequences of these bestial atrocities, we were terribly agitated and determined to fight.</p> 
<p>We knew the war was past winning; but it was our obligation and sacred duty to fight to the last bullet.</p>
<p>The Russian rapes caused many German women to commit suicide.</p> 
<p>The preferred form of suicide was poison, and most Berlin women seem to have been provided with poison before the Red Army arrived.</p> 
<p>Even when Berlin women were not driven so far as to take their own lives, the rapes inevitably caused disease and unwanted babies.</p> 
<p>A high percentage of women became infected with venereal disease.</p> 
<p>Since antibiotics were often unaffordable, eventually the Russians decided to treat the local population themselves.</p>
<img src="image txt/068.jpg">
<p>Abortion was a common occurrence, and many abortions were performed without anesthetic.</p> 
<p>Despite the high incidence of abortion, it is estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 “Russian babies” were born to German women.</p>

<p>The atrocities that the Russian military is doing towards Ukrainian women are like a mirror image of what Soviet soldiers did to German women.</p>
<p>The details of those rapes that the Ukrainian victims agreed to tell about only ominously emphasize this similarity (Below I will give a description of several rapes, from the words of the victims themselves).</p>
<p>Dear Reader!</p>
<p>This article contains some rapes details, it is unfortunately essential to include them, otherwise there is no possible way to comprehend the scale and nature of the Hell unleashed on Ukrainian girls and women.</p>
<p>Thus, you yourself will understand that the Russian soldier always and everywhere behaves the same way – like an animal!</p> 
<p>Red Army soldiers didn't believe in an individual relationship with German women.</p> 
<p>They were ten or twelve men at a time and raped women collectively.</p>
<p>They were free to drink and rape shamelessly.</p>
<img src="image txt/116.jpg">      
<p>One of the reports had — “Germans declared that the soldiers raped all the German women in Prussia who stayed behind.”</p>
<p>Numerous reports stated girls under 18, and older women were not spared.</p>
<p>One of the soldiers had mentioned when women who had their husbands murdered were trying to form a group and retaliate.</p>
<p>“These captured female cats must be destroyed without mercy.”</p> 
<p>Soviet soldiers suggested stabbing them all through their genitals and then execute.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how many women had faced the horror of rape, but some historians' estimates say that possibly as many as two million women were raped.</p>
<p>Most of the women died due to the consequences of internal injuries as they were brutally treated.</p> 
<p>Many rapes didn’t result in pregnancies and some women who got pregnant preferred abortion.</p>
<p>Lack of treatment and badly-performed abortions was also one of the reasons due to which many women faced death.</p>
<p>Staff in the Red Army was said, “Our soldiers’ behavior towards Germans is absolutely correct.”</p>
<p>Some of the German women recorded Soviet servicewomen watching and laughing as the other German women were raped.</p>
<p>Red Army was not an army of people, it was an army of animals who knew only to rape.</p>
<img src="image txt/074.jpg">
<p>These soldiers were not only brutal rapists but were also alcoholics.</p>
<p>The behavior of the russian military in Ukraine only confirms that for almost a hundred years, nothing has changed for the better.</p>
<p>It can be assumed that they actually required some alcoholic courage to attack a woman.</p>
<p>But then, often, they drank way too much that they were most of the time unable to complete the act and used the bottle to insert in the woman’s body.</p> 
<p>This made several victims lewdly mutilated.</p>
<p>These all happenings of the mass rapes of the women in German were done in a much-controlled manner that even today, veterans of Russia refuse to accept what really happened.(such a shame!)</p>
<p>And those handful of them who opened up to speak on them were shameless.</p>
<img src="image txt/117.jpg">      
<p>“They themselves lifted their skirts for us,” said a leader of a tank company.</p> 
<p>He even boasted by saying, “Two million of our children were born in Germany!”.</p>
<p>A Soviet major once told a British journalist during that time that — “Our soldiers were sex-starved!</p> 
<p>They often raped women of all age; from ten to sixty, or seventy, or maybe even eighty.”</p>
<p>When the gang-raped women pleaded with their attackers to put them out of misery, they often said that they must be thankful that the Red Army men did not shoot those women.</p>
<p>Soldiers had one quality in common — to dominate.</p>
<img src="image txt/103.jpg">
<p>The victims of the rape were burning in revenge and represented as a sign of war rape.</p>
<p>In 2022, Russian barbarians the bodies of raped Ukrainian women, are also burned.</p>
<p>Rape is an act of conqueror, and many of those Red Army soldiers took the bodies of the defeated enemy’s woman to affirm victory.</p>
<p>The women who survived the mass rape did not let anyone know that they were victims and later started a new life.</p> 
<p>The women who were raped multiple times were in the majority.</p>
<p>The death rate was much higher among the one million estimated victims in East Prussia, Pomerania, and Silesia.</p> 
<p>Most of them died from suicide.</p>
<p>A former Red army officer once said — “We were young, strong, and for four years without any women.”</p>
<p>Ten men raped one girl.</p> 
<p>There were not enough women as the entire population had run away from the Soviet army.</p> 
<p>Then they attacked the young — eight or ten-year-old girls.</p>
<p>If she cried for help, then they put something in her mouth.</p>
<img src="image txt/109.jpg">
<p>They thought it was fun.</p>

<p>The novelist Vasily Grossman, a war correspondent attached to the invading Red Army, soon discovered that rape victims were not just Germans.</p> 
<p>Polish women also suffered. So did young Russian, Belorussian and Ukrainian women who had been sent back to Germany by the Wehrmacht for slave labour.</p> 
<p>"Liberated Soviet girls quite often complain that our soldiers rape them," he noted.</p> 
<p>"One girl said to me in tears: 'He was an old man, older than my father'."</p>
<p>Nuns, young girls, old women, pregnant women and mothers who had just given birth were all raped without pity.</p>
<p>Women soon learned to disappear during the "hunting hours" of the evening.</p> 
<p>Young daughters were hidden in storage lofts for days on end.</p> 
<p>Mothers emerged into the street to fetch water only in the early morning when Soviet soldiers were sleeping off the alcohol from the night before.</p>
<img src="image txt/113.jpg">      
<p>Older Berliners still remember the screams every night.</p> 
<p>It was impossible not to hear them because all the windows had been blown in.</p>
<p>If anyone attempted to defend a woman against a Soviet attacker it was either a father trying to defend a daughter or a young son trying to protect his mother.</p> 
<p>"The 13-year old Dieter Sahl," neighbours wrote in a letter shortly after the event, "threw himself with flailing fists at a Russian who was raping his mother in front of him.</p> 
<p>He did not succeed in anything except getting himself shot."</p>
<p>Taking the mythical "deliverance from Nazism" as its main idea and reason for war, it continues to rob and rape civilians.</p> 
<p>Not only women, but also very young children and the elderly, become victims of the Russian military.</p>
<p>Soviet propaganda vehemently denied the facts of rapes, but unfortunately, there is no doubt now that all of this did occur and with particular cruelty and on a mass scale.</p>
<p>How historians and eyewitnesses describe mass rapes during World War II.</p>
<p>It is not easy to talk about such things in society in general.</p> 
<p>In West Germany, the guilt felt by the Germans for the crimes of Nazism overshadowed the theme of the suffering of this people.</p>
<p>But in 2008, the film "One Nameless woman in Berlin" was released in Germany with actress Nina Hoss in the title role.</p>
<p>This film was a revelation for the Germans and prompted many women to tell what happened to them. Among these women is Ingeborg Bullert.</p>
<img src="image txt/070.jpg">
<p>Now 90-year-old Ingeborg lives in Hamburg in an apartment full of photographs and books about the theater.</p> 
<p>She was 20 in 1945. When the Soviet attack on the city began, she hid in the basement of her house.</p>
<p>“Suddenly, tanks appeared on our street, bodies of Russian and German soldiers lay everywhere,” she recalls.</p>
<p>Once, during a break between the bombings, Ingeborg crawled out of the basement.</p>
<p>“Suddenly, I saw two Russians pointing guns at me,” she says.</p> 
<p>“One of them forced me to undress and raped me.</p> 
<p>Then they switched places and another raped me.</p>
<p>I thought I was going to die, that they would kill me.”</p>
<p>Martha Hillers, author of the acclaimed book A "Woman in Berlin".</p> 
<p>She wrote in the diary of a woman living in Berlin in 1945 that after being repeatedly raped by Soviet soldiers, she decides to survive at all costs and goes to bed with a Soviet officer to escape the harsher violence.</p>
<img src="image txt/075.jpg">      
<p>One of the witnesses of the crimes committed by the Soviet army, Lieutenant Vladimir Gelfand, kept notes in his diary from 1941 until the end of the war.</p> 
<p>Here is what he writes on April 25, 1945, the day he met two Germans, a mother and daughter, who were fleeing their home:"I asked the Germans why they had left their home, and they told me with horror of what the front lines had done to them on the first night of the Red Army's arrival."</p>
<p>"They're was poked me and there and there, around," the beautiful German woman explained, pulling up her skirt, "all night, and there were so many of them.</p> 
<p>I was a girl.</p> 
<p>They took my virginity.</p> 
<p>There were old, pimply ones among them, and they all got on me, all poked me.</p> 
<p>There were at least twenty of them, yes, yes," she burst into tears.</p>
<p>"They raped my daughter in front of me," the mother interjected, "they might still come and rape my girl again," they came to their feet in horror and sobbing.</p> 
<p>"Stay with me," the girl suddenly rushed to me, "you will sleep with me."</p> 
<p>You can do whatever you want with me, but only you alone, will be my man!"</p>
<p>Kobelev was so struck by what was happening in East Prussia that he later wrote in his book "Keeping Forever."</p> 
<p>"Why were there so many bandits among our soldiers, who were raping women, girls, laying them out in the snow, in back alleys, killing unarmed people, destroying everything they could, shitting, burning.</p>
<p>And they destroyed senselessly, just to destroy."</p>
<p>It was the Soviet army that made the violence and killing of civilians massive.</p>
<img src="image txt/104.jpg">
<p>British historian Anthony Beevor in his book "The Fall of Berlin 1945" tells about the attitude to the population of occupied Germany.</p> 
<p>Convoys of refugees were crushed by tanks, shot from the air, women and young girls were raped and left to die.</p> 
<p>Russian propagandists and historians respond to Biwak's research in their usual manner of "you all lie" and "And you can prove that?"</p>
<p>Russian writer Leonid Rabichev, in his book "War Will Write Everything Off," describes scenes of mass rapes as follows:</p>
<p>"Women, mothers and their daughters, lie right and left along the highway, and in front of each stand a cackling armada of men with their pants down.</p>
<p>The bleeding and unconscious are dragged aside, the children rushing to their aid are shot.</p>
<p>Cackling, growling, laughing, screaming and moaning.</p> 
<p>And their commanders, chuckling, take their turn and shoot the witnesses, the hysterical children and the elderly.</p> 
<p>Up to the horizon between mountains of rags, overturned carts are the corpses of women, old people, children."
</p>
<img src="image txt/073.jpg">
<p>"On the steps of the house stands the major, two sergeants have twisted the arms of two girls, and in front of them is a string of staff soldiers.</p> 
<p>The major commands: "Get the girls by the arms and legs, skirts and blouses off!</p> 
<p>Stand in two lines!</p> 
<p>Unbuckle your belts and pull down your pants and underpants!</p> 
<p>Right to left, one at a time, - start on ...!"</p>
<p>More and more ranks of soldiers run and line up for the orgy.</p> 
<p>And the two girls are lying there, their hands in a vice, their mouths covered with kerchiefs, their legs spread apart, - they are no longer trying to escape the hands of the four sergeants, and the fifth soldier tears at them blouses, bras, skirts, rips off their panties and throws them aside.</p>
<p>My women telephonists ran out of the hq, - laughter and mate.</p> 
<p>And the rows of men did not shrink, puddles of blood around the girl-martyrs and in the rows, there was no end to the cackling and foul language.</p> 
<p>The girls were already unconscious, but the orgy continued.</p>
<p>My soldiers'had a good time, says the major.</p> 
<p>Two more sergeants pounce on the two female  half-dead.</p> 
<p>The Major pulls a revolver from his holster and shoots into the bloody mouths of the woman-martyrs, they are dragged away by the sergeants.</p>
<img src="image txt/110.jpg">
<p>War writer Mikhail Koryakov, who did not return to the Soviet Union after the war, describes the scenes of mass rape in his book "Liberation of the Soul" as follows:
<p>Upstairs, above the ceiling, there were women's and children's screams.</p> 
<p>All night long through I listened to the screams of the unhappy women, the cries of the children and the stomping of the heavy soldiers' boots overhead.</p> 
<p>In the morning, a girl rushed to me in tears and begged me not to leave her here.</p> 
<p>Here I learned a terrible thing: in three weeks she had been raped by a total of at least 250 people!</p> 
<p>Frau Wunsch had also been raped, even in front of her husband.</p> 
<p>Two soldiers raped the half-blind Frau Simon.</p>
<p>Grigory Pomerantz, Russian writer and philosopher, in his book "Notes of the Ugly Duckling" wrote: "At the end of the war the idea seized the masses that Germans womens from 15 to 60 years old are the lawful spoils of victory".</p>
<p>Another Russian writer who went through the war, Nikolai Nikulin, recalls:
"Our scouts, who were at the observation post, took advantage of the lull and indulged in merry amusements.</p> <p>They locked the master and the hostess in a closet, and then started to "spoil" the hostess's little daughters in turn with the whole platoon.</p>
<p>Among others is the story of a German woman who, like more than a million other women, was taken from Germany for forced labor in the USSR.</p> 
<p>In the book, Clara M. tells the story of her mother, who was taken to the USSR for forced labor.</p> 
<p>There she was raped so often that she lost count of the rapists.</p> 
<p>In 1948, she returned to Germany with the help of the Red Cross, but her personality and psyche had been irreparably destroyed by her experiences.</p>
<img src="image txt/112.jpg">      
<p>It is largely for this reason that we return to this topic again.</p> 
<p>Today, when the atrocities of the Russian occupants in the cities and villages of Ukraine are massively confirmed, this page of history deserves to be given special attention.</p> 
<p>Because if we do not talk about it, if we do not prosecute the criminals, the nightmare, absolutely unacceptable in today's civilized society, will be repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>Should we be surprised at the brutal brutality of Russian soldiers in Ukrainian cities, where they have invaded and where they commit crimes against civilians as well.</p> 
<p>The unlearned lesson of history, a crime not punished, generates a new wave of cruelty and atrocities.</p> 
<p>And if you accuse the Ukrainians of Nazism, it simplifies things even more.</p> 
<p>If last time society did not condemn the violence, did not publicize it, and found justification for the crimes, the formula "We can repeat it!" becomes effective and practically universal.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the Soviet army at one point tried to deal with mass rapes and other atrocities in the occupied territories.</p>
<img src="image txt/066.jpg">
<p>In today's Russian army, there is nothing of the kind, even in the draft.</p> 
<p>Russian atrocities are simply not recognized at all levels and in the broadest circles of Russian society, and all sorts of excuses are found for them.</p> 
<p>Thus, the spiral of inhuman cruelty spirals even stronger and inevitably leads to disaster, primarily in Russia itself, where the rapists and murderers will return after the war.</p> 
<p>Thankfully, there will be fewer of them returning home, as a result of the success of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>

<p>According to Gavrishko, millions of women and children were not only fleeing from bombs, they were also fleeing from sexual violence, the memory of which is deeply embedded in the nation's memory.</p> 
<p>In the course of her work, she interviewed dozens of elderly women who had been raped during previous occupations and repressive regimes.</p>
<p>According to Gavrishko, it is clear that Russia is once again using sexual violence as a weapon of war.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to verify cases of rape during war.</p>       
<p>If rapes were committed by individual soldiers, more often than not, the perpetrators would try to cover their tracks.</p>
<p>Gavrishko researched the use of sexual aggression in Ukraine during the Nazi occupation and during the Soviet era.</p>
<img src="image txt/114.jpg">
<p>According to victims' testimonies, Russian troops systematically rape in the same way: in a group and with their faces covered.</p>
<p>"These are public rapes, where relatives and acquaintances are forced to watch their loved ones suffer," says the researcher.</p>
<p>The goal is to cause as much suffering as possible, not only to the victim, but to society as a whole.</p>
<p>According to her, rape has the hallmarks of genocide, the groundwork for which has long been prepared in the Russian state media and in speeches by the Russian leadership.</p>
<p>Genocide is a heavy accusation, but Gavrishko says evidence is beginning to emerge to support this interpretation of events.</p>
<p>Russian soldiers referred to the victims as "Nazi whores."</p> 
<p>In Russian propaganda, illegal military aggression against Ukraine is justified by liberation of the country from the Nazi regime.</p>
<p>In another case, the victims were told that rapes would continue until Ukrainian women stopped wanting to be with men and bear children.</p>
<p>These are words that clearly indicate genocide," Gavrishko said.</p>
<img src="image txt/005.jpg">      
<p>According to her, the systematic rapes are clearly linked to the way the Russian leadership and media talk about Ukraine and the Ukrainians.</p> 
<p>A message calling for genocide is broadcast constantly.</p>
<p>They deny the existence of Ukraine as an independent state.</p> 
<p>They spread the idea of the destruction of Ukraine," she says.</p>
<p>As an example, he cites Putin's creepy joke.</p>
<p>"Like it or not, bear with it, my beauty," Putin said in early February during a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, referring to Ukraine and compliance with the Minsk agreements.</p>
<p>Ukrainians heard a grim echo of this joke.</p> 
<p>They knew to fear sexual aggression by Russian troops because their mothers' and grandmothers' generation had experienced the same thing.</p>
<p>The female body had once again become a battlefield," Gavrishko said.</p>
<p>This is primarily due to the fact that in the occupied territories the invaders keep the cities in fear and do not allow not only human rights organizations and law enforcement agencies, but also doctors to work.</p>
<p>Yet evidence of rape cases is beginning en masse to appear in various media outlets.</p> 
<p>Human rights activists point out that sexual violence committed by the military against civilians during war can be particularly widespread and brutal due to a sense of impunity.</p>
<p>Russian occupants continue to terrorize peaceful Ukrainians in the occupied territories by killing, maiming, and torturing people, raping women, girls, and children.</p>
<p>In liberated areas and cities in Ukraine, locals and journalists have found mass evidence of sexual violence by Russian soldiers.</p> 
<p>There are many people in towns are unlikely to ever fully recover from the horror they have endured.</p>
<p>Most of the victims now seek support from psychologists, and in order to document the crime, they must testify to the police," - she explained.</p>
<img src="image txt/003.jpg">      
<p>The number of reports of rapes increases every day, but it will not be easy to understand the real scale of what is happening.</p> 
<p>In response to the question whether it is possible to estimate the scale of sexual crimes committed by Russian troops during the occupation, the ombudsman shrugs his shoulders.</p>
<p>"At the moment - it's absolutely impossible: not everyone is yet ready to tell what happened to them," - said Lyudmila Denisova.</p> 
<p>Member of the Ukrainian Rada Maria Mezentseva, in an interview with Sky News, also spoke in detail about the stories of women who were subjected to sexual violence.</p> 
<p>The Maria Mezentseva said that such "victims are actually much more."</p> 
<p>Mezentseva did not say how she knew about the other victims.</p> 
<p>But she promised that soon there would be more data and "we'll definitely not be silent," - she assured.</p>
<p>She said Ukraine wants a special U.N.tribunal to try Vladimir Putin personally - on charges of war crimes, including rape.</p>
<p>In an online discussion hosted by the British think tank Chatham House, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said: "When bombs are falling on cities, when Russian soldiers are raping women in Ukrainian cities, then it is difficult, of course, to talk about the effectiveness of international law."</p>
<p>The one who raped and shot them is to blame, as well as the one who drove the murderer there on a tank, and the one who ordered them to break through the border with Ukraine.</p>
<p>The one who hid in the bunker and decided to invade was also guilty.</p>
<p>The wives who happily support this is also guilty.</p>
<p>We will never forgive this.</p>
<p>We will hate them forever.</p>
<img src="image txt/046.jpg">
<p>After this statement, reports about the rape of Ukrainian women by Russian occupants were spread by many foreign media, including reputable ones, such as Reuters.</p> 
<p>But the Russian authorities do not acknowledge the rapes.</p> 
<p>Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the information about the murders and rapes in Bucha "false provocation" as early as April 5.</p>
<p>Russia officially denies the facts of war crimes against civilians in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov called the information about rapes committed by Russian soldiers on the territory of Ukraine a lie.</p>

<p>Recall that earlier, the SBU press center has already released more than one audio interception of conversations of Russian occupants.</p>
<p>Russian fascists during conversations with their loved ones talk about how they loot and rape women in the occupied territories of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Russian military themselves tell how they broke into houses, shot men, and then raped women for hours, and after they raped them, many women were killed or these women died from bleeding.</p> 
<p>"The Second Peace Army," as they called themselves, turned out to be common looters, murderers, and rapists.</p>
<p> During conversations with their loved ones, the Nazis talk about the terrible crimes in the occupied territories of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of reports of rape, human rights activists and volunteers were involved in the collection of evidence.</p>
<p>The situation is complicated by the fact that some territories are still under Russian control, and volunteers and lawyers cannot collect testimony from victims.</p> 
<p>But more importantly, it is especially difficult for survivors of rape to talk about their rapes.</p>
<p>Most victims of sexual crimes do not report it.</p>
<p>So this is the easiest way for the Z-putler to demoralize Ukraine's civilians, and he uses it.</p>
<p>Russian troops have almost completely destroyed the cities of Irpen, Bucha, Vorzel, Gostomel, Mariupol and other settlements of Ukraine.</p>
<img src="image txt/092.jpg">
<p>Since the first days of the war, thousands of people have been trying to get to safe places.</p> 
<p>Those who have succeeded tell of war crimes committed by the Russian army.</p>
<p>Residents of liberated Ukrainian towns accuse the Russian military not only of looting and looting, but also of raping civilians.</p>

<p>Russian occupants commit kidnappings, rape, including gang rape, subject women and children to perverted forms of sexual violence, mutilating their genitals, accompanying their atrocities with ethnic insults and death threats, after which they were often hanged and burned.</p>  
<p>The murders were massive, the corpses were lying in houses and on the streets, - Alexei Arestovich in live on YouTube channel Feigin LIVE said.</p> 
<p>These are raped women, murdered children, people shot in the streets.</p> 
<p>A lot of people - hundreds of bodies, with their hands tied, killed in the back of the head," - Arestovich said.</p>
<p>The Russian military put people on their knees against a wall and shot them in the head.</p>
<p>"Reports of rapes come from all occupied regions of Ukraine.</p> 
<p>These crimes are reported by survivors and eyewitnesses.</p> 
<p>They report group and multiple rapes by occupiers.</p> 
<p>Women were rape in the presence of their family members and threatened with killing them children or other family members.</p> 
<p>"These are real cases, real people and real facts," - Turtle said.</p> 
<p>Many victims of violence aren't willing to talk about what happened to them, she said, while others fear for their lives.</p> 
<p>Most of those who talk about these crimes are those who managed to get to safer places, but they are too traumatized and need psychological support first.</p>
<p>Expert Katerina Busol notes that the most shocking for her are the testimonies of women who have been abused in front of their families and children: "It is an additional level of humiliation."</p> 
<p>You have no value as a person, as a woman, or as a family member.</p> 
<p>We are here to suppress you in any way we can, including forms of sexual violence.</p>
<p>"Until February 2022, I had not encountered such cases as in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine," - Katerina Busol said.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, sexual violence is almost a traditional aspect of war," - says Katerina Busol.</p> 
<p>There is a dehumanization of the enemy, which, combined with events on the battlefield, catalyzes violence that is projected onto women.</p>
<p>From the occupied territories, reports of sexual violence barely trickle down to the outside world due to their isolation and the suspension of communication networks.</p>

<p>But this is what 80% of Russians are proud of.</p>

<p>Most of these women were either shot after being raped, or committed suicide, or were unable to get out of the Russian blockaded areas and died from bleeding from ruptured organs.</p>
<p>Many of the raped women were pregnant!

<p>"Hide the Girls": Russian soldiers rape and torture Ukrainian women.</p>
<p>Women and girls at risk!</p> 
<p>The moderately adequate, if that's what you can call murderers, Russian soldiers, warned the Ukrainian women to lie low themselves or the soldiers would rape them.</p>
<p>The Russian soldiers themselves said that the Kadyrovites, members of a paramilitary organization from Chechnya named after its leader Ramzan Kadyrov, had settled in the neighboring village of Shiben and that they were brutal rapists.</p>
<p>"A Russian soldier approached the husband and said: "Don't let a woman out," pointing at me," Tatyana Aleksandrova, a 38-year-old resident of Bucha, told Kyiv Independent.</p> 
<p>She was hiding in the basement of an orphanage, along with her husband and other local residents.</p>
<p>She constantly wore several jackets to appear bulky and unattractive, and the woman running the orphanage said she used to smear soot on Tatyana's face when Russian soldiers came.</p>
<p>Women in the nearby village of Shibene, tell stories of bloody rapes of women in their village.</p>
<p>A 34-year-old woman witnessed awomen being raped by Kadyrovites and killed by their and neighbors.</p>
<p>The journalist did not disclose the woman's name, citing ethics.</p>
<p>However, she received permission from the woman to tell her story to Kyiv Independent.</p>
<p>"When this woman came, she was speechless, she could not say anything.</p>
<p>When she started to speak, she was getting hard to breathe," the journalist said.</p>
<p>She saw a 16-year-old girl and a 48-year-old woman, whom she had known all her life, raped and then hanged.</p>
<img src="image txt/060.jpg">
<p>Karina Ershova, a 22-year-old resident of Bucha, a city near Kyiv, was raped, then tortured and killed by Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>A week before she would have turned 23, Karina Yershova was killed by Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>She was tortured and raped, Karina's stepfather Andrei Dereko told the Kyiv Independent.</p>
<p>Then they shot her in the head.</p>

<p>According to Dereko, his stepdaughter was a diminutive woman who worked as a manager at a local sushi bar and posed no threat to anyone.</p>
<p>The police did not show Karina's body to her parents, saying it would be too shocking to see.</p>
<p>Buried in a closed casket in Bila Tserkva, Kyiv region, one day after her identity was established.</p>
<p>Dereko asked the detectives to at least show him pictures of his stepdaughter's dead body.</p>
<p>They showed him only the upper part of Karina's body.</p>
<p>What he saw was horrifying.</p>
<p>"There were cuts and lacerations, there was also a piece of flesh torn from her ribs," he said.</p>
<p>"Obviously she had been tortured."</p>
<p>The police told Dereko that Karina's leg had also been shot.</p>
<p>Apparently, she tried to stop the bleeding with a tourniquet.</p>
<p>He suspects that Karina tried to defend herself, which only made the perpetrators more angry.</p>
<p>In 2014, when Russia invaded Ukraine in the east, Karina and her family fled their native Donetsk.</p>
<p>They managed to escape and moved to a quiet suburb of Kiev.</p>
<p>Eight years later, Russian troops arrived there as well.<p>
<p>Karina's parents immediately evacuated.</p>
<p>She lived separately and refused to join them.</p>
<p>"Throughout the day of February 24, we tried to persuade her to leave," Dereko said, recalling the first day of the full-scale Russian invasion.</p>
<img src="image txt/047.jpg">
<p>She underestimated the risks, believes Dereko: "I can understand her."</p>
<p>Who would have thought that these beasts would kill ordinary people?</p>
<p>Wars are not waged against civilians, but for territory, she thought.</p>
<p>"Here they were fighting for refrigerators, for goods, with ordinary people," - Dereko said, referring to the mass looting by Russian soldiers in the homes of Ukrainians.</p>
<p>A terrible story of a 16-year-old girl from the Chernihiv region about how her family was abused by the Russian military during the occupation of their village.</p>
<p>On March 10, the Russian invaders drove into one of the Ukrainian villages, from which the Ukrainian military drove them out in early April.</p>
<p>The commander settled in the house where an elderly woman lived with two grandchildren, and every day terrorized his victims.</p>
<p>If you don’t give yourself to me voluntarily and resist and scream, then I will kill grandmother and brother,” - said the Russian occupier to the 16-year-old girl.</p>
<p>“He hit me here, – Maria (the name of the victim of severe violence is not real), sobbing, points near the temple, after he grabs me hand the on throat and said, if you be screaming when I will touch you (will be raping), I will break your neck."</p>
<p>“The army officer, pushed me into the room, said: “Be quiet, be quiet.”</p> 
<p>He threw me on the bed.</p>
<p>He sat on top and began to choke me.</p>
<p>"I screamed. My eyes were already dark and I was panting. And when I couldn't get any air, he would stop choking me,” - Maria says, still crying.</p>
<p>She added that the rashist, threatening her with a weapon, ordered her grandmother to sit in another room and not go out.</p>
<p>“I understood what would happen, I felt bad, and I fell," – the girl continues.</p>
<p>And he said, ‘You’re all lying,’ and hit me on the head.”</p>
<img src="image txt/028.jpg">      
<p>She, a bit older brother, he will to tied up at night and left him to sleep on the street.</p>
<p>On the first night, the brother heard how the occupier was bullying his sister.</p>
<p>“I remember his face, I remember his voice, I remember everything, I wanted to kill him every night," - Maria is crying again.</p>
<p>Maria said that the Russian sadist beat and raped her many times and where he wanted.</p>
<p>And he adds that the rashist said that after the war he would find her and kidnap her.</p>
<p>“He says, come with me, you will live in wealth, in gold, I will not offend you,” - recalls Maria.</p>
<p>Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova notes that there are already many teenage girls in Ukraine who became pregnant after being raped by Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>Sexual abuse of Ukrainian women and children is a weapon of the Russian army.</p>
<p>This is genocide, the Russian soldier does not stop – he to rape's everyone.</p>

<p>For example, in occupied Berdyansk, a serviceman of the Russian Federation, under the threat of physical violence, raped a 29-year-old local girl, Anna A.</p>
<p>According to local social networks, the invaders, threatening with reprisals, forced the girl's boyfriend to run away, and the girl was forced to let them into her home.</p> 
<p>According to Berdyansk social networks (a number of publics), this case is not an isolated one.</p> 
<p>It went public because the rape victim was unable to travel to Ukrainian-controlled territory.</p> 
<p>It is reported that the girl and her boyfriend walked down the street to her house.</p> 
<p>Then they were approached by the Russian military, who were pretty drunk and with weapons.</p> 
<p>So, the invaders told the guy that if he wants to live, then let him “run fast.”</p> 
<p>The Russian military told the girl that they were going to rest at her home.</p> 
<p>From the food she bought, they demanded that the table be set for them.</p>

<p>The British Newspaper «The Times» published the story of a woman who had been sexually abused by Russian occupiers.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian woman, for the first time, agreed to talk about it.</p> 
<p>The journalist specified that the heroine agreed to be interviewed for one purpose: to dispel the notion that allegedly "reports of rape are too shocking to be true.</p>
<p>Using the pseudonym Natalia, the 33-year-old Ukrainian told the reporter that she and her husband Andrei (not her real name) was lived in a small village near Brovary.</p>
<img src="image txt/083.jpg">      
<p>On March 8, the Russians entered the village and the couple hung a white sheet on the gate "to show that only family is here and no one wants any harm."</p> 
<p>The next morning they heard a single gunshot outside the house and the gate being broken down.</p> 
<p>As they came out of the house with their hands up, they saw a group of soldiers, one of whom was holding a rifle pointed at their dead dog lying in the yard.</p> 
<p>"They said they didn't know there were people here, that they didn't mean any harm," Natalia said.</p> 
<p>"All the usual tales, the Russian occupiers - 'we thought we were going to Ukraine for exercises, and we didn't know we were going to be sent to war.</p>
<p>Later, the soldiers went to look for petrol for the ATV, which they had stolen from a neighbor.</p> 
<p>The commander introduced himself to Natalia as Mikhail Romanov, and said that had it not been for the war, they would surely have had an affair.</p>
<img src="image txt/082.jpg">
<p>"Mikhail was drunk at the time. I asked them to leave because my son was scared, he was only four years old.</p> 
<p>I told them: "You can leave, you checked the house, and now you're just scaring the kid."</p>
<p>Romanov became angry when he saw her husband's camouflage jacket in Natalia's car and opened fire on the car.</p> 
<p>Then he threatened to blow up the car with a grenade.</p> 
<p>Then he took the keys from the woman, started the engine, and drove the car into a tree.</p> 
<p>After dark, they heard a noise at the gate, and the husband went out to check what was going on.</p>
<p>"I heard a single gunshot and then the sound of footsteps in the house," Natalia said.</p> 
<p>It was Romanov, who returned with another man in his twenties.</p> 
<p>"I screamed where my husband was, then I saw him on the ground by the gate.</p> 
<p>The younger guy put a gun to my head and said: "I shot your husband because he's a Nazi."</p>
<p>According to the woman, at that moment her 4-year-old son Alexei (a pseudonym) was hiding in the boiler room.</p> 
<p>The soldier who shot her husband told her: "You better shut up, or I will bring your child and show him his mother's brains scattered all over the house."</p>
<p>"They told me to take my clothes off.</p> 
<p>Then they both raped me one by one.</p> 
<p>They didn't care that my son was crying in the boiler room.</p> 
<p>They told me to shut him up and go back in.</p> 
<p>During the rape, they held a gun to my head and mocked me.</p>
<p>They said amongst themselves, "Do she sucked well? Kill her or let her live?,"- Natalia recounted."</p>
<p>After a while, the soldiers left, and she went to her son.</p>
<img src="image txt/043.jpg">
<p>After the incident, Natalya's 4-year-old son was paralyzed with fear and refused to move.</p> 
<p>The Russian occupants returned about 20 minutes later to rape the woman again.</p> 
<p>"When they came back a third time, they were so drunk they could barely stand on their feet," Natalia said.</p>
<p>"Eventually they both fell asleep in their chairs.</p> 
<p>I snuck into the boiler room and told my son that we had to run really fast, or we would get shot.</p> 
<p>While I was opening the gate, my son was standing next to the body of his dead father, but it was dark, and he didn't realize it was he.</p> 
<p>He asked: "Are we going to be shot just like this man here?" Natalia reported.</p>
<p>She eventually managed to flee with her son to Western Ukraine to the city of Ternopil, where her relatives had already been evacuated.</p>
<p>"I could have kept quiet, but when we got to the police, my husband's sister made me talk, and there was no way back," The Times quoted her as saying.</p> 
<p>"I understand that a lot of people who have been hurt will keep quiet because they are afraid and ashamed," she said.</p> 
<p>A lot of people don't believe that horrible things like this happen.</p> 
<p>One of the women I talked to told her neighbors about what happened to her, and people said, 'Stop making up stories."</p>
<p>Natalia still hasn't told 4-year-old Alexei about his father.</p> 
<p>"He doesn't understand a lot... Here at the playground, he comes up to people and says that we had to leave our house because there was a war and there were bandits in the house, and his dad stayed.</p> 
<p>He doesn't know that his father is dead," she said.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the woman, she cannot bury her husband because their village is still occupied by enemies.</p> 
<p>Natalia noted that she does not know how she will live with all this.</p>
<p>Natalia recognized Romanov from his social media profiles, and later found out that he was accused of multiple rapes.</p>
<p>Last week she was told that one of her rapists, believed to be Romanov, had been killed by Ukrainian troops in Bovary, but the woman does not yet know if this is.</p>

<p>A resident of the village of Malaya Rogan in the Kharkiv region told Human Rights Watch the story of how a Russian soldier took her daughter and raped her at school.</p>
<p>In addition to the rape of this girl from Kharkiv region, the HRW report mentioned other cases of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers, particularly in Mariupol and villages in Chernihiv region.</p>
<p>According to Olga [name changed] a 31-year-old woman, Russian troops entered the village on February 25.</p> 
<p>On that day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, took refuge in the basement of the local school.</p> 
<p>She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister and her 24-year-old brother.</p>
<p>Around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olga said: "He broke the windows at the entrance to the school and knocked on the door.</p> 
<p>The guard opened the door.</p>
<p>The soldier with a submachine gun and a pistol went into the basement and ordered everyone to line up there.</p> 
<p>A woman stood in line, holding her sleeping daughter in her arms.</p> 
<p>He told her to give to someone the girl, but she refused.</p> 
<p>He told her brother to come forward and ordered the others to kneel or else, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement.</p>
<p>The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food.</p> 
<p>They left and returned an hour or two later.</p>
<p>"People started asking if they could go to the bathroom, and he let them in groups of two and three," Olga said.</p> 
<p>After that, people started settling in for the night.</p> 
<p>A soldier approached her family and told her to follow him.</p>
<p>The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. 
<p>"He told me to give him oral sex," - Olga said.</p>
<img src="image txt/084.jpg">
<p>The whole ..... time he held the gun to my temple or aimed it at my face.</p> 
<p>Twice he shot the ceiling and said it should give me extra 'motivation.'</p> 
<p>He raped her and then told her to sit in a chair.</p>
<p>She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she only had to wear outerwear, not pants or underwear.</p> 
<p>"While I was getting dressed, the soldier told me that he was Russian, and that he was 20 years old.</p> 
<p>He said I reminded him of a girl he went to school with."</p>
<p>The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things, so she could stay in the classroom with him.</p> 
<p>She refused. "I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me," she said.</p> 
<p>The soldier took a knife and told her to do as he said if she wanted to see her child again.</p> 
<p>The soldier raped her again, put the knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck.</p> 
<p>He also cut her cheek with a knife and cut off some of her hair.</p> 
<p>He hit her in the face with a book and punched her several times.</p>
<img src="image txt/008.jpg">
<p>Photos she shared with Human Rights Watch of March 19 and 20 show cuts and bruises on her neck and face.</p>
<p>Around 7 a.m. March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes.</p> 
<p>They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier cigarettes.</p> 
<p>After receiving the cigarettes, the soldier left.</p>
<p>She and her family went to Kharkiv that day, where volunteers provided her with basic medical care.</p> 
<p>They moved to a bomb shelter. "I'm lucky to be alive," she said.</p> 
<p>She said authorities in Malaya Rogan had contacted her and her mother and were preparing a criminal complaint, which they planned to file with the Ukrainian prosecutor's office.</p>

<p>We met Anna (name changed) in a quiet rural area, 70 km west of Kiev.</p>
<p>When an armed man in a Russian army uniform broke into her and her husband's house on March 7, both spouses were at home.</p> 
<p>Anna calls the attacker a "Kadyrovite," a young, thin Chechen fighter.</p>
<p>"At gunpoint he took me to a neighboring house, ordered: "Take off your clothes, or I'll shoot you.</p> 
<p>And then he started to rape me.</p> 
<p>The man said: 'I will rape you until you be afraid of the thought of a man,'" the woman recalls through her tears.</p>
<p>"While he was raping me, four more soldiers came in.</p>
<p>I thought I was dead," but they told him to leave.</p> 
<p>I never saw him again," Anna says.</p>
<p>When the woman returned home, she found her wounded husband there.</p> 
<p>When her husband rushed to save Anna, the gunman shot him in the stomach.</p>
<p>The incessant fighting prevented her husband from being taken to a hospital, and he died two days later from his wounds.</p>
<p>The servicemen who saved Anna from her attacker stayed in her house for several days.</p> 
<p>They took her at gunpoint and demanded she give them her murdered husband's things.</p>
<p>She thinks that the soldiers who rescued her were from a different unit of the Russian forces.</p>
<img src="image txt/054.jpg">
<p>They behaved strangely, as if they were drunk, she recalls, and when they left, Anna found a possible explanation, having stumbled across the Dimedrol, glue, and... female Viagra.</p> 
<p>"They're on drugs," the woman said confidently. - Most of these people are murderers, rapists and looters. 
<p>There are few normal people there."</p>
<p>Telling her story, Anna cries almost incessantly.</p> 
<p>She cries particularly hard when she shows me the place where she buried her husband.</p> 
<p>So far, instead of a monument or gravestone, there is a simple wooden cross at the head of the grave, which she dug in herself with the help of her neighbors.</p>
<p>How can such things happen in the 21st century?</p> 
<p>In the name of what?</p> 
<p>That's what I want to ask putin.</p>
<p>We are not savage primitive people, why can't we negotiate?</p> 
<p>Why do we have to invade and kill?</p> 
<p>Ludmila Denisova says that Anna's case is not unique: murders and rapes in war with Russians are commonplace.</p>

<p>After meeting Anna, we heard another gruesome story.</p>
<p>According to neighbors, before raping Anna, the same Kadyrovite militant raped and killed another woman, about 40 years old, who lived in a neighboring house.</p>
<p>According to neighbors, the woman was taken from her house and raped in a neighboring house, which was empty because its inhabitants managed to evacuate at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>The bedroom, a beautifully decorated room covered with rich wallpaper, was now the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>There are large blood stains on the mattress and blanket.</p>
<p>In the corner is a mirror with a lipstick inscription.</p>
<p>On the mirror is written: “She tortured by unknown people.”</p>
<p>Another neighbor, named Oksana, said that the inscription was left by other fighters, also from the Russian military.</p> 
<p>They found the woman already dead.</p>
<p>“These Russian soldiers told me that she was raped and either her throat was cut or stabbed – she died from loss of blood.</p> 
<p>There was a lot of blood, there were no clothes on the body and a long, deep cut across her throat,” – Oksana recalled.</p>
<p>The grave was dug in the garden of her house.</p>

<p>Psychologist Vasilisa Levchenko was told by a client that her underage daughter had been subjected to cruel violence and was in the hospital.</p> 
<p>“The mother of an underage girl asks the psychologist how the daughter should be treated when she is discharged from the hospital.</p> 
<p>And why from the hospital, I ask her.</p> 
<p>The mother is in tears, – she was stitched up all over her crotch, she has torn apart and bleeding everywhere,” the woman told me.</p> 
<p>Beware, below you can read descriptions of events that may upset you.</p>
<p>The story of a woman who escaped the Russian occupation: “The Russian military, robbed, abused, cut faces, brutally raped.”</p>
<p>The Kadyrovites entered the village where the woman and her underage daughter lived.</p>
<p>There were no men in the village at the time.</p>
<p>Three “kadyrovtsy” entered the house, where the family lived, and ordered the woman and her underage daughter not to make a move, while they went into the house, opened drawers and took everything of value from there.</p>
<p>After that, the two men began raping the daughter and the third man also began unbuckling the belt.</p> 
<p>The woman began screaming and begging him not to touch the child, but to take her instead of her daughter.</p>
<p>"The third man was raping my client.</p> 
<p>She only remembers that she prayed for her daughter can to endure two soldiers,” Levchenko told BBC News Ukraine.</p>
<p>Next, the mother's memories are fuzzy. </p>
<p>When it was over, she brought her unconscious daughter to consciousness.</p> 
<p>The girl was bleeding, she was helped by a neighbor, then the women managed to get to the hospital.</p>
<p>The girl did not speak for several days.</p> 
<p>The psychologist does not know what happened to the mother and daughter.</p>
<p>“There is such a wave of stories in Poland now from volunteers that women come to them who have become pregnant during a rape.</p> 
<p>And they face a moral dilemma: what to do, because abortion is banned in Poland, and the woman wants to get rid of such a consequence of her trauma. We work with the medics who work with these women, with the paramedics.</p> 
<p>They say there is a lot of it, but it is impossible to give statistics,” Vasilisa Levchenko continues.</p>

<p>"Apostrof" tells in detail about how the Nazis behave in the occupied territories
Ukrainian nurse told about the atrocities of the "orcs".</p>
<p>One such terrible story was shared by a Facebook user - she relayed the words of an acquaintance, who works as a doctor.</p> 
<p>The woman said that recently people were brought to her, who had been previously captured by the occupants in captivity, - among them were girls aged 15 to 20.</p>
<p>According to this woman, the Nazi bastards repeatedly raped these girls and left signs of their abuse. 
<p>She noted that the cruel victims were bleeding.</p>
<p>"They are not human beings.</p> 
<p>They are beasts, animals, freaks and murderers.</p> 
<p>All Russians are murderers," was how the doctor commented on the incident.</p>
<p>"About 25 girls and women, ages 14 to 24, were held and systematically raped in the basement of a house in Bucha during the occupation.</p>
<img src="image txt/077.jpg">
<p>Nine of them were pregnant.</p> 
<p>"The Russian military said they would continue to rape them until they could no longer even think about sex - so that they would never give birth to Ukrainian children," - Ombudsman Lyudmila Denisova told the BBC in a commentary.</p>
<p>According to Denisova, psychological support services are working with the victims.</p>

<p>The ombudsman recounted a hotline call from a 25-year-old woman who reported her 16-year-old sister had been raped.</p>
<p>"The woman said that right in front of her eyes, in the street, Russian soldiers raped her 16-year-old sister. <p>While they were raping, they shouted, 'This will happen to every Nazi prostitute,' -  woman said.</p> 
<p>The ombudsman noted that at the moment it is impossible to establish the number of such cases, because not all victims are willing to tell what happened to them.</p>
<p>“From what we see now, including how numerous such cases are, and how often multiple victims are involved at once, I assume that rape has now become a weapon of war,” Anosova said.</p>
<p>The lawyer believes that Russian soldiers now use sexual violence as a weapon of war against Ukrainians.</p>   
<p>It is a very specific type of crime.</p> 
<p>“Now rape happens in private households of the victims,” she said.</p>
<p>Many of them share stories of how Russian soldiers commit sex crimes.</p>
<p>The details of sexual crimes are important to the investigation, but many of the affected refuse to give intimate part of their rape, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>In open sources, they usually report: “The Russians soldiers woman raped in all possible places,” without disclosing details, according to which it is possible to assess the real degree of atrocities of the Russian occupiers.</p>
<p>With the permission of the victim, the paramedic told the terrible intimate details of the rape of the client, without giving her name and the scene of the incident, citing ethics.</p>
<p>A woman who was raped by Russian soldiers in an occupied village turned to her for medical help.</p>

<img src="image txt/091.jpg">
<p>According to the victim, a 31-year-old Katerina (not her real name), events that night unfolded It's awful from the start.</p>
<p>In the evening, four drunken invaders broke into her and said they intended to look into the house and leave.</p>
<p>During a search, the russian invaders found a photo of brother in military uniform and said that she was a Nazi whore.</p>
<p>She tried to explain to the occupiers this is a Ukrainian uniform of a security guard, not the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and asked the invaders to leave the house.</p>
<p>The invaders were “keep their knees in booze” and weren't going to leave.</p>
<p>We will be eating, drinking, bonking, and you will be sucking and substitute your butt, said the senior occupier.</p>
<p>The otherwise he threatened would harm her child.</p>
<p>They looked like real child molesters.</p>
<p>I was damn scared and thought only about how to protect the child and did not dare to refuse the armed and drunken occupiers, – Katerina told.</p>
<p>Bastards ordered her to strip, and told to do an enema and lube the back passage.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, she did everything right for herself and injected a dose of morphine.</p>
<p>Then the pigs put his hands all over her, did all kinds of things to her.</p>
<p>The scoundrels grabbed her by the hair and threw her on the bed and passed around in three places at once.</p>
<p>From them stunk so bad in briefs, what, I couldn't even breathe, I was wanted to spit them cum one by one, but bastards slapped my face and forced to swallow, I was vomiting, – the woman told.</p>
<p>Every time I threw up, scums said it’s like marking the of a Nazi Slut and laughed.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this desecration, Katerina hoped that the violence was over and asked scums to leave.</p>
<p>But, the scoundrels of the previous bullying were not enough, and they prolonged the suffering of the woman.
<p>The invaders treated her like she was nothing.</p>
<p>Katerina could hardly tell about everything that happened later.</p>
<p>The woman said that the senior scoundrel put the bottle on the floor and told: “Love it when a whore was farting so hard that the whole bed is shaking (scum laughed wickedly).</p> 
<p>Take lube, and shaking the hips, until do make a gaping hole in your back passage.”</p>
<p>For illustrating, her showed a video in which a girl knew from a neighboring village was kneels upside down and roughly receives five fingers in a gaping point.</p> 
<p>My legs became like where jelly out of fear, I gave it a shot to disassociate ourselves from this process, but scum slap me more times than I can remember, – the woman told.</p>
<img src="image txt/048.jpg">      
<p>I was forced to waved hips up and down on the bottle in a cowgirl position.</p>
<p>Bastards were shooting to video it and shouted: “Let's, do jump like mare, do pulled your shithole down to the floor.”</p>
<p>I'm jumped till my legs got stiff, but scums call me a lazy slut and began to skewer me on the bottle by force, I stretched painful and slid down, – the woman told.</p>
<p>I was like me been torn apart from inside, in eyes went black, my belly swelled so much that me sick to my stomach, I never felt so stretched, bastards didn't let get up, – the woman recalled with horror.</p>
<p>The rapists lifted me from the bottle off, was getting strong burning and horrible feeling, as if I get a vacuum pit in my stomach, scoundrels climbed inside me with their fingers, photographed from backside, and laughing, – the woman said.</p>
<p>Thereafter, bastards her was bent over as if she were some kind of cow and at first in pairs took in the back passage with double penetrations, thereafter the Katharina still roughly was receiving five fingers in a gaping point.</p>
<p>The imbecile forbade her to touch his bonking hand, and periodically weighing a good slap in the face.</p>
<p>His f*cking hand reaching in my stomach, the gut had uncurled from inside, my legs did shaking, I was felting how my stomach has been swelling and deflating from internal movements, – the woman said with horror.</p>
<p>It was more awful feeling than just a hole in my stomach this time, bastard hand cut into my bladder, I wet herself, creature got tear me, I was afraid that I'll bleed out, but everything worked out, – woman said.</p>
<p>The morphine worked well, I tried not to hear wet sounds and just lay and waited for it mockery to be over, – Katherine said.</p>
<p>When the creatures dealt with her, they ordered the woman to bring them a hot snack.</p>
<p>She added botulinum toxin to their food in the hope that scums would kick the bucket.</p>
<p>The bastards were pretty drunk, so they just passed out after eating.</p>
<p>The woman closed the ventilation ducts and windows in the house, opened the valves of the gas stove, and was able to escape with the child to a safe area.</p>
<p>Later, she found out that four dead assholes found in her house!</p>
<p>I would have thought so, – said Katherine.</p>
<p>For me, it doesn’t matter if these creatures had poison by gas or fade away from botulinum toxin, the main thing the bastards kick the bucket, said Katerina.</p>
<p>This is retribution for the evil they unleashed that night, these creatures will receive a special cauldron in hell.</p>
<p>It's something you wouldn't come back from, morphine saved me!</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would not have physically been able to escape, – said Katerina.</p>
<p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) intercepted phone calls and published are conversations between russian soldiers, to their girlfriends and wives.</p> 
<p>On recording released by the SBU, a woman is heard encouraging her husband to rape Ukrainian women.</p>
<p>“You go ahead, rape Ukrainian women and do not tell me anything,” a woman is saying, giggling. “Alright,” her husband replies.</p>
<p>Journalists of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty identified the couple whose conversation was recorded.</p> 
<p>They are soldier Roman Bykovsky and his wife Olga Bykovskaya, from the Russian city of Orel, who moved to Crimea after the Russian occupation.</p>
<img src="image txt/093.jpg">
<p>The recording suggests that the published fragment is part of a longer dialogue.</p> 
<p>The man turned out to be Roman Bykovsky, an enlisted man of the Rosgvardia a member of the 108th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment, which took part in the annexation of Crimea.</p> 
<p>It was here that he moved his family from Russia not long ago.</p> 
<p>Fragment of the phone conversation in text form:</p> 
<p>You, do rape the Ukrainian broads!</p> 
<p>And don't tell me anything!</p> 
<p>You understand?(laughs).</p>  
<p>Rape and say nothing to you? </p> 
<p>Yes!</p>  
<p>Why?</p> 
<p>I will not know this and will not be jealous to Ukrainian broads (laughs).</p> 
<p>I can, right?</p> 
<p>Yes, you may!</p> 
<p>Just use protected sex, suddenly you're raped a sick Ukrainian broad!</p> 
<p>Okay!</p> 
<p>It was in the Kherson region in April 2022, as “Schemes” managed to find out, that there was a Russian who was on the phone when his wife “allowed” him to rape “Ukrainian women”.</p> 
<p>Sources in the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine told “Schemes” journalists the phone numbers of the callers involved in this conversation.</p>
<p>As Radio Liberty found out, these numbers were used when registering two accounts on the VKontakte social network: in the name of 27-year-old Roman Bykovsky and Olga Bykovskaya, nee Pinyasova.</p>
<p>The couple has a son, he is 4 years old.</p>
<p>Radio Liberty called Roman Bykovsky.</p> 
<p>He confirmed that this was his first and last name, and when asked if he was staying in the Kherson region, he answered in the negative and said that he was in Sevastopol.</p> 
<p>Having asked who was calling him and found out that it was a journalist, Bykovskiy said that the voice on the wiretap published by the SBU did not belong to him.</p> 
<p>A recording of the conversation made by Radio Liberty shows that his voice is identical to the one in a conversation about, – “Ukrainian broads“ We also got through to Olga Bykovskaya.</p> 
<p>The woman's voice also completely matched the voice on the audio recording published by the Ukrainian Secret Service.</p> 
<p>Olga Bykovskaya confirmed to Radio Liberty that her husband is in Sevastopol, specifying that he is being treated in a hospital after being wounded.</p> 
<p>According to Olga, she does not know where exactly Roman Bykovsky was wounded.</p> 
<p>After this answer, Olga Bykovska interrupted the conversation and began dropping further calls.</p> 
<p>Neither Roman Bykovskiy nor his wife answered our messages on social networks.</p>

<p>There have been reports of rape almost from the very beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the scale of such crimes began to appear only after the withdrawal of the Russian army from the occupied cities and villages.</p> 
<p>One girl does not speak well, because when she was raped, she was hit in the face, and now she has no teeth. Three girls raped by Russian soldiers – they are 16, 17 and 20 years old – are now in Tallinn.</p> 
<p>The psychologist says that he works with them individually.</p> 
<p>Katerina does not know their real names and does not ask too many questions yet – sometimes the conversation lasts only 5-10 minutes, then the girls start crying.</p>
<p>“Two girls from Bucha, one from Irpen,” continues Katerina Galyant. Mostly girls say: “I don’t see the meaning of life”, “I have suicidal thoughts”, “I can’t sleep”, “I can’t eat”, “I can’t touch myself, I hate my body” and so further.</p> 
<p>The stories of all three raped victims were very similar, the psychologist says.</p> 
<p>“At first I thought that this was a one moral freak, a pervert,” said Katerina Galyant.</p> 
<p>The soldiers came in groups, and they all did the same thing!</p> 
<p>Maybe they had such an order from the command.</p> 
<p>The victims told the same story.</p> 
<p>The stories of the victims were divided into three parts.</p> 
<p>First, the Russian military went from house to house, recorded whether there were men among the women and took away their mobile phones.</p> 
<p>Then the soldiers looted: according to Catherine, “even the cheap electric iron was taken away from one of her girl”, after which the atrocities began.</p> 
<p>“Russian soldiers took away all the girls, because in fact only women and children remained in the houses, and no one knows what they did with them there,” says Galyant.</p> 
<p>All three girls say that the soldiers went to the residential buildings in groups of different ages, from three to five people.</p> 
<p>Most were young soldiers up to thirty years old, and with them there was always someone older, forty-five, fifty years old.</p> 
<p>"Roughly speaking, were their fathers,” – says the psychologist.</p> 
<p>In the evenings they came into the houses.</p> 
<p>All the military, as the victims recall, were drunk.</p> 
<p>“If there was booze in the house, they drank it all, sat in the kitchen, forced the girls to cook something for them, if there was anything in the house.</p> 
<p>And then the rapes began,” says Ekaterina.</p>
<img src="image txt/095.jpg">
<p>If we talk about girls, then more often it was gang rape.</p> 
<p>And the more the girls resisted, the more brutal the soldiers were.</p> 
<p>One girl had her teeth knocked out, she said that she screamed and tried to scratch their face and resist.</p>
<p>But against five men, a 16-year-old girl…” Yekaterina, a 17-year-old client, lost consciousness during the rape: “And she was even glad about it.</p> 
<p>All three girls managed to escape from the house when the soldiers who raped them fell asleep," they barricaded themselves in the basement and did not come out.</p> 
<p>There were already dead people in the basement, there was no food, and they could not get out. 
<p>Ekaterina asked the girls where they found water in the basement?</p> 
<p>They were in the basements of old houses, where there were sewer pipes they did holes in them and drew water in. “One girl has abrasions, a broken arm and a bad bruise,” - she says.</p> 
<p>They say that when for the first time they went into the shower, they wanted to wash themselves and, in general, rip off their skin.</p> 
<p>And that's what girls start to do: shower, pour alcohol solutions into the vagina and anuse.</p> 
<p>But if two weeks have already passed, and they have infections or pregnancy, then this issue needs to be addressed.</p> 
<p>They raped girls from 14 years old, some of them pregnant, from fucking rapists.</p> 
<p>Let me explain: “From the invaders!</p> 
<p>Russian soldiers who first stole household appliances, things and gold from their homes of these girls in order to bring a trophy to their wives, and then raped peaceful Ukrainian women.</p> 
<p>Three Katerinas, two Ninas, one Ellya are the most difficult, they are numb and do not say a word. Residents of the village of Zagaltsy, Kyiv region, had to hide two young women from Russian soldiers until early April, Roman Vagrant told Mediazone.</p> 
<p>Russian soldiers occupied the village in early March.</p> 
<p>“Alcohol, cigarettes and women were all that interested the occupiers,” - says Roman.</p>
<p>The girls were hidden because someone told the soldiers that there are girls in the village, and they need young women.”</p> 
<p>After the departure of Russian troops, the nephew of one of the residents of the city found the body of a murdered woman in the basement under his barn.</p> 
<p>"She was sitting with a fur coat over her naked body.</p>
<p>They had shot her in the head,” the New York Times report described the incident.</p> 
<p>She was shot in the head, two shell casings were found nearby.</p> 
<p>When the Ukrainian police took the body and searched the basement, they found condom packages in the basement and a used condom in the house.</p>
<img src="image txt/062.jpg">
<p>“The psyche has a point of tolerance above which it can no longer tolerate.”</p> 
<p>Victims do not say what happened to them, especially if they do not have injuries that require immediate medical attention, says the psychologist.</p> 
<p>She suggests that over time, many will start talking more.</p> 
<p>There are no official statistics on military rapes in Ukraine, and psychologists are limited by ethnic norms.</p> 
<p>“Due to the patriarchal nature of society, not many women will spread rumors that they have been raped,” says volunteer Leonid Romanov, who helps Ukrainian refugee women evacuated to Poland.</p> 
<p>In Poland case of termination of pregnancy, it is possible only in case of danger to the life or health of the mother.</p>
<p>It will take years to collect information about the rapes perpetrated in Ukraine by Russian soldiers, but the scale of such crimes is already becoming clear.</p> 
<p>Since the Russian army had left the Kyiv region, Ukrainian women began to talk about their dreadful experience of violence and rape to psychologists and volunteers.</p>

<p>During the occupation of settlements in the Kyiv region, the occupiers raped women and children.</p> 
<p>Psychologist and psychiatrist Lilia Shakalova says that the parents of two girls raped by Russian occupants in the Kiev region approached her.</p> 
<p>“One girl is 9, the other 11 years old.</p> 
<p>The girl, who is nine years old, is very badly torn apart.</p>  
<p>She has already been stitched up.</p> 
<p>The second girl was stitched up the did from backside, the doctor was found.</p> 
<p>They suspect that the second one may be pregnant, because she already had her period, and now she hasn't.</p> 
<p>But that could be because she was nervous,” said the psychologist.</p>
<p>According to her, one girl was raped in Bucha when her mother went to get water.</p> 
<p>The girl and another child were left behind.</p> 
<p>Then the Russian occupants burst in and raped her and beat a woman nearby.</p>
<p>The mother of the raped child came back, and the woman who was being beaten shows: “Quiet, quiet, don't scare the child.”</p> 
<p>Because the mother saw her bloody baby and wanted to scream.</p> 
<p>And the girl says, “Mommy, it hurts, Mommy, it really hurts.”</p> 
<p>This is a 9-year-old child. And the second child, an 11-year-old girl, she doesn't have a father.</p> 
<p>They lived with their grandmother.</p> 
<p>This girl was raped in front of her, she was screaming, she was hit in the face, it was scary,” says the psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Both girls are now safe with their parents and undergoing therapy.</p> 
<p>She is now giving them psychological help.</p>
<p>Now her job as a professional is to separate the sex life from what happened to them.</p>

<p>Russian invaders are beginning to realize that they are not like the army of “liberators,” some are even ashamed of their colleagues' crimes against civilians.</p> 
<p>The invaders themselves in telephone conversations with their loved ones directly confess that they commit crimes against civilians in the temporarily occupied territories.</p> 
<p>That they kill peaceful Ukrainians and commit terrible atrocities. Why?</p> 
<p>Because “people are going wild,” he said.</p> 
<p>In particular, a fragment of a telephone conversation between a Russian soldier and his relatives was made public, where he directly says that the rapists should be shot.</p> 
<p>Thus, it became known about two more cases of rape.</p> 
<p>The recording of the intercepted telephone conversation was published in the press service of the SBU.</p> 
<p>The invader told his interlocutor that Russian soldiers raped a woman and a 16-year-old girl in a village, but did not specify in which village.</p> 
<p>The occupant said that it happened because the soldiers “didn't know what to do.”</p> 
<p>“People here are getting savage, they have fun in neighboring villages, they catch women and girls and rape them,” said the soldier.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that the command is not going to do anything about it, says the occupant.</p>

<p>The russian occupants commit rape in the occupied territories, but so far these cases simply cannot be documented.</p> 
<p>This was stated by Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs, on the air of Radio Svoboda.</p> 
<p>This is evidenced, in particular, by the conversations of the invaders intercepted by the Ukrainian special services, Gerashchenko claims.</p> 
<p>“In one of the conversations, the occupant admits that he raped a Ukrainian woman.</p> 
<p>And why we do not have written facts now?</p> 
<p>Because in the occupied territories, first of all, the orcs knock out mobile communications.</p>
<p>People don't even have anywhere to call.</p> 
<p>Secondly, they are very scared, because in fact they are at the complete disposal of the occupants.</p> 
<p>The occupants are shooting civilians, if they think they have to.</p> 
<p>They will answer for this,” Gerashchenko said on air.</p>
<p>In the intercepted conversation that Gerashchenko mentioned, a Russian soldier described a rape allegedly committed by another Russian serviceman: “Dude, my friend. Here, look, I drove a tank into the yard… I went into the house, took out the fucking door, shot everybody, took everything what he wanted and f*cked all the broads as where he wanted.”</p> 
<p>Radio Liberty asked the russian Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to comment on the information about the rape of female Ukranian citizens by Russian servicemen.</p> 
<p>No response was received.</p>

<p>A Russian occupant raped 29-year-old Lyuba for more than a week, and then killed her ailing mother.</p> 
<p>Her friend Vera Khvust told this gruesome story, which occurred in the Kharkiv region, on social media.</p> <p>According to Vera, the woman could not evacuate, because she did not know how to take out her lying mother.</p>
<p>Soon, three Russian servicemen entered their apartment.</p> 
<p>They took all the food out of the house.</p> 
<p>But one man remained.</p> 
<p>He raped Luba for over a week, and then "started confessing his great love and said he wanted to go with her, away from the war."</p> 
<p>Luba refused, saying she would not leave her mother.</p> 
<p>Then the Russian soldier shot her lying mother.</p> 
<p>"Now Lyuba is on her way to a rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad," says Vera, who, cannot stop crying from what she has heard.</p>

<p>The representative of BBC News Ukraine, got to Bucha a few days before the journalists got there.</p> 
<p>“I see a tendency for rape cases to increase against the background of Ukraine gradually reclaiming the occupied territories,” Legenka suggested.</p> 
<p>She was right.</p>
      
<p>The Russian military hanged women after rapes in the Kyiv region - Arrestovich.</p>
<p>The murders of civilians were very brutal.</p> 
<p>Ukrainian women were mass raped by Russian occupants, after which they hanged and burned.</p> 
<p>This was reported by the advisor to the head of the Office of the President Alexei Arestovich on the air of the YouTube channel Feygin LIVE.</p>
<p>“Dead civilians on the side of the highway, 20 km from Kiev.</p> 
<p>On Zhytomyr highway – 5 bodies of young women who were thrown out of cars, stacked together, doused with diesel fuel and tried to set fire.</p>  
<p>“The occupants raped the women, and afterwards, tried to burn their bodies to hide their crimes,” – said Arestovich.</p>
<p>He also added that many citizens were killed because they were bystanders to the crimes of the occupants.</p>
<p>They killed, and when they saw someone in the street, they tried to catch up with them and shoot them, so there would be no witnesses.</p> 
<p>They tried to mop up witnesses,”- Arestovich explained.</p>

<p>Cases of rape in the occupied territories are also confirmed by Ukrainian psychologists, who are directly approached by the victims.</p> 
<p>Vasilisa Levchenko recounts the story of her client and her underage daughter on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“The Kadyrovites came to them, to their settlement.</p>
<img src="image txt/099.jpg">
<p>The woman tried to persuade the Kadyrovites not to take her daughter, but to take her. 
<p>Unfortunately, only one of the men agreed to this.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, because all the other soldiers were raping the daughter.</p> 
<p>Her daughter was in a serious condition at the time of our conversation.</p> 
<p>The woman did not go to the hospital because, as she said, she was raped by one of the Kadyrov men, she only needed a shower and douches”, Levchenko says.</p>
<p>The Russian military, inhumanely abused civilians, including women and even underage girls.</p> 
<p>A Ukrainian told The Guardian about the tortured bodies in the forest near Bucha.</p>
<p>The bodies of the dead girls hung on trees, – said Oksana Litvinenko.</p>      
<p>They tortured, beat and raped them and then hung the bodies of their victims on trees.</p>
<p>They were all young, naked and torn apart.</p>

<p>Oksana Litvinenko, a Ukrainian woman living in Warsaw, told The Guardian's reporter Veronika Strzyżyńska about this in a commentary.</p> 
<p>She was shown such evidence of atrocities by her countrymen who had fled from the war to other countries.</p>
<p>According to her, when the women on the border told of rapes and murders taking place in Ukrainian towns and villages occupied by Russian troops, she thought that these were just horror stories or that they were just trying to rationalize their guilt for abandoning their men and sons in this way.</p>
<p>Then, Oksana added, a woman in her 70s crossed the border with her daughter and great-granddaughter, saying she was from one of the occupied territories near Irpen and Bucha.</p> 
<p>Oksana was told by a Ukrainian acquaintance that her grandson served in the military brigade that first went to the recently liberated areas. He photographed what he saw.</p> 
<p>And when her compatriot showed the woman pictures from Kiev, it was only then that she realized in Poland that what was happening was worse than she could have imagined.</p>

<p>‘Since she showed the photo to me, I think my brain has tried to blank it out,’ the says Oxana Lytvynenko.</p> 
<p>When women at the border started talking to me about rapes and murders happening inside Ukraine, I thought these were just rumours;</p> 
<p>I wouldn’t let myself believe it.</p> 
<p>I told myself that it was just people sharing scare stories or that women were just trying to rationalise their feelings of guilt about leaving their husbands and sons.</p> 
<p>Maybe my psyche was trying to defend itself.</p>
<p>Then a woman in her 70s, who said she was from one of the occupied areas close to Irpin and Bucha, crossed the border with her daughter and great-granddaughter.</p> 
<p>They were being treated by medical volunteers at the French mission.</p> 
<p>The daughter,  had cancer and was very sick.</p> 
<p>The medics could not believe that someone like this, with a hole in her stomach and no bandages, was so desperate to leave that she would risk travelling for so many hours with no medical support.</p>
<p>The woman told me that her grandson served in a military brigade that had been the first to go into recently liberated areas.</p> 
<p>She said he took photos of what he had seen.</p> 
<p>She showed them to me, and it was only then I understood it was worse than I could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>She said that after her grandson had returned from duty, he had come to her house and begged her to leave Ukraine.</p> 
<p>He told her that women were being raped and killed by Russian troops but she refused to leave.</p> 
<p>In desperation, he showed her the photos and she knew she had to flee.</p>
<p>One of the photos she showed me was the hanging body of a young girl.</p> 
<p>She couldn’t have been more than 14.</p> 
<p>She said her grandson told her he was walking through the woods looking for dead bodies left by the Russians and lifted his head and saw these girls strung from the trees, all of them very young.</p>
<p>They were naked and torn up.</p>
<img src="image txt/002.jpg">
<p>She said he had passed on the photos to investigators in Ukraine who were gathering evidence of war crimes.
<p>I was not ready to see something like this, - she said.</p> 
<p>In Ukraine now there are many photos of what happened in Bucha but in Poland these are not widely circulated.</p> 
<p>Since she showed it to me I think my brain has tried to blank it out because I can’t even recreate it in my mind.</p> 
<p>All I remember is a white blur in the top-left corner of a shattered phone screen.</p>
<p>She told me that after she had seen these photos she went to the hospital where her daughter was being treated in the oncology ward.</p> 
<p>She went in, took out her daughter’s intravenous drip and helped her walk to the car and they just took off.</p>
<p>A refugee from Ukraine sits with her luggage in the railway station in Przemyśl, Poland.</p> 
<p>‘You worry about all the women who make the crossing,’ says Oxana Lytvynenko.</p> 
<p>‘There are many who just cannot deal with being this helpless.’</p> 
<p>When I met them on the border, the car they were driving was shattered.</p> 
<p>The lights were broken, they had foil instead of windows.</p> 
<p>They had driven all that way in a car where the wheels were still turning but that was about it.</p> 
<p>But this lady said that after she started driving she didn’t stop until she had left Ukraine.</p>
<p>Often when women first cross the border they’re elated, happy to reach safety.</p> 
<p>They start smiling, joking – you’d never guess they’ve had any sort of trauma.</p> 
<p>Since I have seen that photo, I keep thinking back to those other women I have met and wondering what they might have gone through.</p>
<p>There have been women who have been asking me about getting hold of pills that cause menstruation.</p> 
<p>At the time I didn’t understand what they meant.</p>
<img src="image txt/050.jpg">
<p>There was another woman who came over with a 17-year-old daughter.</p> 
<p>The daughter would not stop crying.</p> 
<p>I asked her how I could help, and what was going on.</p> 
<p>She asked for thick menstrual pads, underwear and trousers for the girl.</p> 
<p>I remember her as she had the same name as my own daughter.</p> 
<p>That woman also told me that when she went through the last checkpoints outside Kharkiv, she kept driving without stopping.</p>
<p>There was one woman, you could tell that she was wealthy.</p>
<p>Her clothes were very nice, her shoes were very nice.</p> 
<p>The children were dressed nicely. And from their manners you could tell they were well-off.</p> 
<p>And their older girl, about 10, sat at the table in the reception centre and said: “Well, here you have free soup.”</p> 
<p>And the little boy said: “I don’t want a free soup.”</p> 
<p>The mother sat not saying anything until she just exploded and yelled: “You’re refugees now, and you need to eat everything they give you.”</p>

<p>Ukrainian human rights activists also spoke about rape in the occupied territories.</p> 
<p>Darya Kaleniuk spoke on Twitter about two rapes in the Kyiv region.</p> 
<p>Kalenyuk specified that she cited the story of her friend, whose name she did not disclose.</p>
<p>“My friends, two young girls, were captured, tortured, raped and then killed.</p> 
<p>One of them was a brilliant doctor, the other was a scientist with a doctorate,” the defender cited the testimony of her friend.</p>
<p>The President of La Strada Ukraine, Katerina Turtle, told NM that among the testimonies gathered, gang assaults at gunpoint and rapes committed in front of children.</p>
<p>“Our hotline has received calls from women and girls looking for help, but in most cases it is physically impossible to help them. We couldn't get to them because of the fighting,” – said Katerina Turtle.</p>
<p>According to her, rape is a crime that is underreported, and it is a stigmatized problem: “I am afraid that what we find out about will be just the tip of the iceberg.”</p>

<p>Another story of a Ukrainian woman raped by Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>Correspondent Yulia Koltak visited Zhytomyr, where she spoke with one of the victims of the occupation.</p>
<p>Maria lived in Kharkov before the war. The girl is 28 years old.</p>
<p>“We thought that it would be safer to wait in the village and then return to Kharkov.</p> 
<p>There were five of us, girls and women. We got into the car and went to our girlfriend's parents.</p>
<p>But the village was occupied by Russian troops.</p> 
<p>The house where the girls were hiding was next to a grocery store.</p>
<img src="image txt/079.jpg">      
<p>“Russian soldiers robbed the store and pulled out absolutely everything – we saw through the window.</p> 
<p>Then three came to our house,” Maria continues the story.</p>
<p>At this moment, she begins to cry, the girl's hands are trembling. Maria continues.</p>
<p>“Three came to our house, not Chechens, not Buryats, Slavic appearance.</p> 
<p>Young guys, 25 years old maximum.</p> 
<p>They asked if there were men in the house.</p> 
<p>With us was the father of a colleague, he is over 60, they asked for his documents.</p> 
<p>Our documents were also asked. While two were talking to a colleague's dad, one said to me: "Come with me.”</p> <p>Well, that's where it all happened.</p>
<p>“I didn’t understand what was happening, I was in a stupor. We went into the room, he closed the doors and said to turn around with your back to him, take off your underpants, bend down and not scream.</p> 
<p>Well, then … It lasted about 10 minutes, then they called him, he pushed me into the wall, pulled on his pants and left.</p>
<p>I couldn't scream – I was in shock, horror.</p>
<p>I understood that if I screamed, the girls might rush in to save me, and they would shoot us all.</p>
<p>I blamed myself for not resisting, now I understand that if I had resisted, no one would have survived, – Maria said.</p>
<p>What punishment would you wish for this soldier?</p>
<p>The most terrible death to him, and to his entire family, and to these freaks who came with him, and in general to everyone who came to our country.</p>

<p>Affected women said that of them were held captive and raped constantly, in most cases by groups of several men.</p>
<p>The French "Figaro" published a story about the victims of Russian military violence in the occupied territories of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Girls aged 10, 16, 17 and even young women 19, 20: they are all unable to speak, they in such shock that many cannot remember their own name.</p>
<p>Girls have the terrible physical consequences of being raped.</p>
<p>The Russian invaders not only raped them, but also knocked out their teeth.</p>
<p>As the correspondent of Le Figaro notes, the stories of rape are so similar, "as if the Russians had planned everything in advance."</p>
<p>Soldiers checked who lived in houses, killed men, took away money and valuables, ate and drank, and when drunk, raped women and children.</p>
<p>Just imagine this nightmare, girls are 10-16 years old their hands are tied, have vaginas torn apart and rectum inlet.</p>

<p>The Commissioner for Human Rights, Lyudmila Denisova, wrote on her Facebook page that in the occupied territories of Ukraine, Russian occupiers rape women, underage girls and boys.</p>
<p>In Bucha, a 14-year-old girl was raped by five occupiers, she is now pregnant.</p>
<p>In Irpin, two invaders raped a 20-year-old pregnant woman; she lost her child.
<p>In the same place, the Russian military raped an 11-year-old boy in front of his mother, who was tied to a chair to watch.</p>
<p>A psychologist published a photo of a drawing of an 11-year-old boy from the Kyiv region, whom the Rashists raped in front of his mother.</p>
<p>After what he had to endure, the boy lost his speech.</p>
<p>Now he starts to talk a little.<p>But so far only in a few words.</p>
<img src="image txt/051.jpg">
<p>In Irpen, three occupiers simultaneously raped a 20-year-old girl in all possible places at once.</p>
<p>This was announced by the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova.</p>
<p>“There is no place on earth or in hell where racist criminals could hide, ”- she wrote.</p>

<p>A 14-year-old girl from Bucha, who was raped by five Russian invaders, is currently pregnant.</p>
<p>The doctors warned that if the victim had an abortion, she would probably not be able to have any more children.</p>
<p>Now doctor Alexandra Kvitko is working with 5 more girls aged 14-18 who became pregnant as a result of rape by Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>A 12-year-old girl went out into the yard to pick flowers and please her mother.</p> 
<p>The girl went out into the street, although her mother forbade her to do this: the Russian invaders were already in the city.</p> 
<p>Later, the mother found her unconscious daughter in the yard.</p> 
<p>The girl was gang raped. After the incident, the girl tried to commit suicide.</p>
<p>"The girl blamed herself: She went outside, even though her mother forbade her to do so," says Kvitko.</p>     
<p>The youngest girl raped is 10 years old.</p>
<p>Alexandra Kvitko also talks about her own sisters, the youngest of whom was raped in front of her older sister.</p> 
<p>The older sister got down on her knees and asked the soldiers to take her instead of her younger sister.</p> 
<p>The soldiers said: “No, you have a going to watch,” says the psychologist.</p>
<p>In the central square, friends Elina, 19, and Sofia, 16, say they were in town throughout the occupation.</p> 
<p>Friends Elina, aged 19, and Sofia, aged 16, say they were in the town all through the occupation.</p> 
<p>We tried to hide together. “But nowhere was really safe, not in the house or in the basement,” Elina says. <p>According to Elina, they knew the soldiers were looking for young women their age.</p> 
<p>When the Russian soldiers left town, the girls learned that 15- and 16-year-old sisters from a family they knew had been raped.</p> 
<p>“It happened here, in a house very close to us,” Elina says.</p> 
<p>Sofia says she feels her hometown differently after the occupation.</p> 
<p>The realization that Russian soldiers were here, invading people's homes, left an indelible fear.</p> 
<p>Here, Russian soldiers were killing and raping civilians.</p> 
<p>When the cities were liberated, it turned out that people were shot not only in their homes but also in the streets, shooting at car drivers and bicyclists.</p> 
<p>In eastern and southern Ukraine, the Russian occupation continues.</p> 
<p>No one knows exactly what is happening there.</p> 
<p>Of Alexander Kvitko's 94 patients, only five have so far reported rape by Russian soldiers to the authorities.</p> 
<p>The vast majority of the victims are women and children, but men were also sexually abused during the military aggression.</p> 
<p>It took a long time before the men started calling Alexandra Kvitko.</p> 
<p>The shame is too great.</p>

<p>In Vorzel, her mother and a 14-year-old boy were killed in front of a 15-year-old girl.</p> 
<p>The Russian occupants brutally raped her and filmed the abuse on their phones.</p>
<p>A volunteer from Kazakhstan saved the young Ukrainian girl: she managed to get out and climb into the trunk of his car when he was bringing food for local residents to Vorzel.</p> 
<p>The volunteer told Channel 24 about the horror that the child had to endure during the occupation, as well as about the fate of the girl.</p>
<p>A native of Kazakhstan, Konstantin Kyastutisovich once asked Ukraine for political asylum: at home he was persecuted because of his human rights activities. Lately the man living in Bucha.</p>
<p>When the Russian-Ukrainian war broke out and the occupants entered the Kiev region, he began rescuing local residents.</p> 
<p>The man used his Kazakh documents, – and so was able to pass enemy checkpoints and bring humanitarian aid into the occupation. And back to pick up people to take them to safety.</p>
<p>He also had to go to russian-occupied Vorzel.</p> 
<p>There, the invaders deployed a significant amount of weapons and personnel.</p> 
<p>The civilians were not allowed out of the village, women, children, and the elderly were used as "human shields.</p>
<p>Having learned that the Ukrainians in Vorzel had nothing to eat, Kyastutisovich decided to take provisions there.</p>
<img src="image txt/064.jpg">
<p>“I drove up and put food out of the trunk. At that moment, a girl crawled into the trunk.</p> 
<p>I didn't even see her.</p> 
<p>I saw, when I drove away, that there was a child lying between the seats, just squeezing into them.</p> 
<p>When I looked at her, she just said: “Save me.</p> 
<p>I was so scared then, because I knew something was wrong, and they might be looking for her,” Kastutisovich recalled that day.</p>
<p>He said that the 15-year-old terrified child lay motionless and silent until they reached the Ukrainian checkpoint.</p> 
<p>Later, the girl told of the terrible abuse to which she had been subjected by the Russian occupants.</p>
<p>In front of the child, the Rashists killed a 14-year-old boy and seriously wounded her mother.</p> 
<p>The woman bled for two days and eventually died.</p> 
<p>The girl herself, the Russian non-humans kept in the basement and raped for 10 days.</p>
<p>“When she told me the whole story, I didn't sleep for two days, – the man said.</p> 
<p>I just cried, I couldn't imagine that in the 21st century people could do such things, – the man said.</p> 
<p>It was 20-year-old guys, Russians, who abused her.</p> 
<p>They were drinking, raping her, filming it on the phone.</p> 
<p>They actually took out their hatred for Ukraine on her, on this 15-year-old girl,” said Kyastutisovich.</p>
<p>Now the young Ukrainian girl is undergoing rehabilitation after the horror and abuse she endured in Latvia.</p>
<p>The abuses were committed against girls and women as well as men, as well as children and elderly people of both sexes.</p>

<p>History, from which the blood runs cold.</p>
<p>In Irpen, Russian invaders killed the parents of a 9-year-old girl, and then 11 invaders brutally raped the child.</p>
<p>The letter "Z" was carved into the baby's chest - Reuters.</p>
<p>The details of the terrible story that happened during the occupation of the Kyiv region were told on Facebook.<p>The events were described by journalist Alina Dubovskaya.</p>
<p>"The parents of the child were killed by the Rashists and their nine-year-old daughter saw it.</p>
<p>The little girl was raped by eleven, I can't find a word to say who.</p>
<p>11 (eleven!) soldiers.</p>
<p>Probably, there is no such word in the Ukrainian language to call these Russian geeks!</p> 
<p>At least At least the examination showed that there were just so many different sperm samples on the girl’s body.</p>
<p>The child had no genitals, nonhumans simply tore them apart, "the woman wrote.</p>
<p>“They didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>Russian scum carved the letter "Z" on the angel’s chest and ripped open her stomach,” she added.</p>
<p>My hatred boils!</p>
<p>Do you want to say that only Putin is to blame for everything?</p>
<p>But Putin personally did not do this!</p>
<p>All, all, all of Russia must answer for this!</p>
<p>These passive participants in the war are just as guilty as those who came to kill and those who started the war!</p>
<p>I wish death in hellish torments to all who are from Russia: old people, youth, children and grandchildren!</p>
<p>Do not take Russian swine-dogs prisoner: burn, kill, blow up, and leave their stinking corpses to rot!</p>

<p>Here is another brightest representative of "russian World,” -Alexey Bychkov.</p>
<p>This animal filmed a sexual scene with a child for sale on the dark web.</p>
<p>Addressing the Lithuanian parliament, the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, noted that due to the war of the Russian Federation against our country, hundreds of children were left without parents.</p>
<p>At the same time, the exact number of victims among Ukrainians as a result of the Russian invasion is unknown today.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of cases of rape are reported, in particular, of underage girls or young children, even babies.</p><p>It’s scary to talk about it, but it’s true, it happened,” – Zelensky said of the crimes of Putin’s army.</p>
<p>The President stressed that the identity of the monster who committed such abuse of the newborn has already been established.</p>
<p>We are talking about the Russian occupier Alexei Bychkov from Pskov - he is a paratrooper or commando.</p>
<p>“He sent his comrades a video of what he was doing with the baby, how he was mocking him.</p>
<p>Here is such a Russian military “protector of children.</p>
<p>Such a “special operation” that was planned in Moscow.</p>
<p>This vile story corresponds to the "russian World”!</p>
<p>Now it will be associated with the Russian army, Russian paratroopers who raped a baby," the Ukrainian leader stressed.</p>
<p>He also suggested that the Kremlin propagandists must have already begun to make excuses for such actions of a serviceman of the RF Armed Forces.</p>
<p>“As always, they will argue that this did not happen, and if it did, then it is” self-defense.</p>
<p>“Those who educate such paratroopers will also be responsible for such crimes,” Zelensky stressed.</p>
<p>NEXTA's Twitter notes that the Russian pedophile occupier who filmed pornographic content with a baby is Alexei Bychkov did this “for the sake of selling on the darknet.”</p> 
<p>He was caught after he sent a video of the child to his friends.</p>
<p>Earlier, the media published a photo of a Russian soldier-criminal.</p>

<p>In another conversation, a russian soldier tells his interlocutor that his friend broke into the house where the family lived.</p>
<p>He shot his parents and raped his daughter.</p>
<p>The village of Berestyanka in the Kyiv region was occupied by Russian troops for more than two weeks.</p><p>Almost three months have passed since then, but people still cannot return to their usual lives.</p>
<p>People cannot forget the atrocities of the Russian invaders.</p>
<p>For residents, every day in the occupation seemed like a real hell.</p>
<p>People were driven out into the street, their houses were looted, their cars were taken away.</p>
<p>Things that were not of interest as valuables were simply spoiled or burned.</p>
<p>Russian soldiers deliberately showed their rage to intimidate the residents.</p>
<p>But on the fourth day of the occupation, the Russian military, together with the commander, being drunk, decided to have fun with local women.</p>
<p>Girls were dragged out of their houses, and men who tried to hide their wives were simply shot.</p>
<p>So Zoya lost her son-in-law and almost lost her daughter.</p>
<p>The husband told the soldiers that he would not give his wife to them, and they shot him, – said the mother of the raped woman.</p>
<p>After shooting Alexander, the Russian soldiers dragged his wife Natalya out and took her with them.</p>
<p>She was their second victim.</p>
<p>Victoria, the Russian military, seized even earlier.</p>
<p>Women were led to be raped, at gunpoint, as if they were going to be shot.</p>
<p>Natalya returned home only the next day, and Victoria managed to escape that same night.</p>
<p>The woman was scared to death that other soldiers could be waiting for her at home.</p>
<p>Victoria was trembling with fear.</p>
<p>In the woman's eyes were only pain and emptiness.</p>
<p>She told her neighbor about all the atrocities she had experienced, begged to hide her and her husband.</p>
<p>The woman was sure that when the Russian soldiers found them, they would definitely not let them live and would shoot them.</p>
<p>If three, and especially the one who raped Vika, wanted again, then he would go to looking for her in their house.</p>
<p>And then in all the houses, but it’s good that this didn’t happen,” said Viktor, a family neighbor.</p>
<p>The couple hid at Victor's until the Ukrainian military drove the occupiers out.</p>
<img src="image txt/088.jpg">
<p>It's been quiet here for several weeks now.</p>
<p>It would seem that only their broken and burned equipment reminds of Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>But this is only at first glance.</p>
<p>It's just something that certainly catches the eye of visitors.</p>
<p>But what is not immediately noticeable is the absence of women on the streets in Berestyanka and neighboring villages, because they still live in captivity of fear.</p>
<p>He is in every soul and every woman's heart, tormented by suffering.</p>

<p>An elderly woman described how three occupiers seized a woman in the street, forced her to undress and kneel before them.</p>
<p>Then they surrounded her, all at once drop your pants a pant and forced a woman to satisfy them with oral sex.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the invaders threatened to kill her child.</p>
<p>All the while she was on her knees, the child stood by and watched the violence against mother.</p>
<p>The creatures knocked out her teeth and tore her mouth, the woman survived.</p>
<p>“Rape is part of the Russian arsenal”, and we appeal to Ukrainian women: if the Russian Horde approaches your homes, leave.</p>
<p>Don't tempt fate.</p>
<p>Because Russian soldiers are not people, – said the British Ambassador to Ukraine!</p>
<img src="image txt/009.jpg">
<p>Many victims have not yet visited medical facilities, so these figures represent only a small percentage of rapes committed.</p>
<p>“We expect that many of these episodes will become public when the victims are ready to talk about it,” – Mezentseva said.</p>
<p>Women were raped in public, in front of children, girls in front of relatives – deliberately, as an act of subjugation and dehumanization, and this is widespread and aimed at intimidating the victims.</p>
<p>The mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, stated that the soldiers of the Russian army raped not only women, girls, children, but also men.</p>
