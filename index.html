<h2>Ukraine-russia, - Patriotic Liberation War in the center of Europe OR the beginning of the Third World War?</h2>
<p>Greetings to all Citizens of the Civilized World!</p>
<p>Dear Friends, crypto enthusiasts!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, now is not the time to discuss crypto coins!</p>
<p>Therefore, I, like other people, write on Bitcointalk about the War in Ukraine, my Homeland, which I love very much!</p>
<p>Formally, the following text is a continuation of the topic raised in the original bitcointalk.org post.</p>     
<p>"direct link"<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg59390061#msg59390061">CLICK</a>.</p> 
<p>In addition, this detailed post reflects the view of ordinary Ukrainians on Russian aggression against Ukraine!</p>
<p>Ukraine and the World are united as never before, we were not afraid, as the enemy hoped, we rebelled!</p>
<p>The Ukrainian people are heroically destroying the invaders, defending their Motherland and the ideals of the entire Free World!</p>
<p>The enemy suffers numerous losses of military equipment, weapons, aircraft, personnel, his soldiers are demoralized and surrender in batches.</p>
<p>Friends, remember - only together we are strong!</p>
<p>This is not a war of ideologies!</p> 
<p>There is no ideology in Ukraine, there are only the ideals of Freedom!</p> 
<p>With the slave mentality of the soldiers of the country of the invaders, this cannot be understood!</p> 
<p>Therefore, the occupier in this war will definitely be defeated!</p>
<p>As for the military statistics below, these are the official data of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, which do not cause controversy among military experts and people living in countries with free access to truthful information!</p> 
<p>The debate about the reality of these figures with the citizens of the country of a complete ban on the truth has no practical meaning!</p> 
<p>If the citizens of the country of the aggressor, so far, have not had a cognitive dissonance from comparing information from their TV (rus television reports that their losses in Ukraine amount to 498 soldiers) with information from World sources (according to which the losses of the Russian Federation amount to more than 17,500 military personnel), then this is their problem!</p> 
<p>It is obvious to everyone that nothing has changed in Russia since the times of the USSR! In USSR lied to its people about the losses in Afghanistan, now in RF is lying about the losses in Ukraine!</p>
<p>But in the USSR there was no Internet, satellite television, social networks, contacts with foreign relatives!</p> 
<p>In a word, who does not sit on the needle of false propaganda and is looking for truthful information, he finds it! The reality is that everything hidden will become clear and no propaganda can change it, it's only a matter of time!</p>
<p>Of course, it is unfortunate that Russians are not interested in answering a simple question: “Why, after the invasion of Ukraine, did their country become a global pariah?”</p>
<p>The propaganda argument that "everyone is bad, only they are good" in any healthy society will not stand up to scrutiny!</p> 
<p>Simply put, a healthy society will not believe in the correctness of the logic, according to which a plug that does not stick into a hundred sockets is recognized as serviceable, and all one hundred serviceable sockets are declared unusable!</p> 
<p>Nonsense, but a fact!</p>
<p>Of course, this war is disastrous for both peoples, but unfortunately, fooled by false propaganda, 70-80% of Russians still approve of criminal aggression and thirst for the blood of Ukrainians, without even wondering about the reasons for their hatred!</p>  
<p>Only a few sane russians understand the true causes of aggression - this is the  fear ruling of the regime that the Russian people will take an example from the Ukrainian and  will choose Freedom!</p>
<p>Therefore, an adequate minority of the Russian people does not want the blood of Ukrainians, but the blood of their criminal government, which, for an insane reason, sends children, husbands and fathers to certain death in Ukraine!</p>
<p>For example, Russian rock musician Boris Grebenshchikov condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and in his video clip said: “The war between Russia and Ukraine is madness.</p> 
<p>And the people who unleashed it are the shame of Russia!</p> 
<p>Obviously, the Russians do not know that in Ukraine they do not beat with sticks and do not imprison to jail for dissent!</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the majority of the population of the Russian Federation firmly believes in nonsense about some Ukrainian Nazis, about the oppression of Russians in Ukraine and about Stepan Bender, who died back in 1959 in Munich, Germany, nonsense!</p>
<p>Alas, such are the current realities of life in the totalitarian Russian world!</p>
<p>Total combat losses of the enemy 24.02.2022 - 29.03.2022.</p>
<p>personnel - about 17200,</p> 
<p>tanks ‒ 597,</p>
<p>APV  ‒ 1710,</p> 
<p>artillery systems – 303,</p> 
<p>MLRS - 96,</p> 
<p>Anti-aircraft warfare systems - 54,</p>
<p>aircraft – 127,</p> 
<p>helicopters – 129 од,</p> 
<p>vehicles - 1178,</p>
<p>boats / cutters - 7,</p>
<p>fuel tanks - 73,</p> 
<p>UAV operational-tactical level – 71,</p>
<p>special equipment – 21,</p>
<p>mobile SRBM system - 4.</p>
<p>Data is updated. The calculation is complicated by the high intensity of hostilities.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Russian military personnel are poisonous vandals, marauders, thieves, robbers, rapists, murderers of the elderly, women and children.</p><p>Ukraine, according to the generally accepted approach, provides humanitarian and medical assistance to captured or surrendered invaders, this is a fact (there are many interviews of captured invaders on the Internet)!</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, the invaders have a sadistic attitude towards Ukrainians, but this does not surprise anyone in the world! As for the registration of the dead soldiers of the Russian Federation, the summary indicates "about 17200" corpses, because accurate accounting is difficult for a number of reasons! It is difficult to accurately calculate the losses of the occupiers when they were destroyed by long-range artillery.</p> 
<p>Also, only ashes remain from the crew of the enemy armored vehicles destroyed by modern anti-tank systems.</p> 
<p>The invaders do not take the corpses of their soldiers from the battlefields, so the Ukrainians, to the best of their ability, collect them and store them in refrigerator cars, but the Russian command refuses to take these cars to the Russian Federation!</p> 
<p>Thus, the Russian Federation hide from its citizens the true loss Russian soldiers their military-political scam in Ukraine! In this regard, Ukraine launched the site https://200rf.com/ to search for captured and killed Russian soldiers!</p> 
<p>But, this site was blocked in the Russian Federation on the basis of the decision of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation.</p> 
<p>Thus, thousands of corpses of Russian soldiers still lie under the sky!</p> 
<p>While these corpses are being gnawed on by hungry dogs maddened by the explosions, the Russian Federation does not consider this a problem and even a zone of its ethical responsibility to the relatives of those whom the sent to Ukraine for slaughter.</p> 
<p>For Ukraine, the situation with thousands of decomposing corpses is a real threat of a sanitary and epidemiological catastrophe on sovereign territory!</p> 
<p>Of course, the situation is terrible in its essence, but Ukraine did not start this war!</p> 
<p>The Kremlin soldier wanted the Land of Ukraine, but he himself ended up in it!</p> 
<p>This is a natural result, - whoever came to kill a free people, he himself became dead!</p>
<p>In addition to the corpses of russian Orcs, the territory of Ukraine is littered with thousands of tons of their burned-out equipment, and all this scrap metal blocks the passage on roads and streets.</p>
<p>As a result of Russian aggression in Ukraine, cities, towns and civilian infrastructure have been massively destroyed!</p>
<p>The invaders provoked terrible humanitarian disasters in several cities of Ukraine, and the tragic fate of the city of Mariupol as a result of the russian Orcs shocked the entire civilized world!</p>
<p>From the temporarily occupied settlements, the occupiers, by deceit and force, are forcibly deporting Ukrainian citizens to the depressed regions of the Russian Federation!</p>
<p>As a result of the incessant barbaric air bombardments, artillery shelling and missile strikes by Russian ships from the waters of the Black and Caspian Seas, as well as the land territories of Russia and Belarus, it is the civilian population of Ukraine that is dying, which contributes to an increase in the evacuation of civilians to the western part of Ukraine and Friendly States!</p> 
<p>The vast majority are the elderly, women and children!</p>
<p>In just a month of the war, the Russian Federation fired at least 1,500 missiles across the territory of Ukraine! Can you imagine it?</p>
<p>Convinced of the impotence of their "great" army in a direct, ground collision with Ukrainian troops and civil resistance, the cowardly bastards sent all the aircraft and missiles at their disposal to the total destruction of the defenseless civilian population from the air, using prohibited bombs!</p> 
<p>As a result of Russian barbarism, old people, women and children are dying en masse!</p>

<p>In 1986, I happened to come face to face with the atomic grin of Chernobyl, I dare say that a greater Evil came to Ukraine!</p>

<p>By the way, if you want to feel what most Ukrainians felt a few hours ago, take a look at these videos ... the power of explosions of Aviation vacuum bombs and rockets is terrifying even if you are just a spectator, (these are just those moments in life when you want to be away from it all).</p>

<p>Here is what the author of another post wrote: “Imagine that one day you wake up and see that your house came under artillery fire, 5 members of your family were killed, you were forced to become refugees, not knowing if you would ever return to the country, which they have called home all their lives.”</p>
<p>Watch this video too. I warn you, it's impossible to watch without tears! Destroyed houses, shelling of accidents and maternity hospitals, crying mothers!</p>

<p>Here's more about the Russian Mir and its geeks: 33-year-old Ukrainian Natalia (not her real name) said that drunken Russian bastards put a gun to her head, forced the woman to undress, and raped her for several hours. In addition, her husband was shot in the courtyard of their house in the Kiev region.
Natalya's 4-year-old son hid in the boiler room and when the invaders fell asleep, she and her son fled on foot, as the invaders smashed her car.

<p>The author of another post on Bitcointalk wrote: “I survived a bloody war and I know very well what it means when grenades and plane bombs fall around you, and you wonder every moment if it will hit you too. Your country is currently in the same situation as mine in 1991, when Serbian butchers set out to demolish and kill everything in front of them, not sparing even small children or pregnant women. But I think every Ukrainian is worth at least 10 Russian soldiers who are actually very unmotivated and I'm sure they are not very happy to do such things. A man who defends his home and his country always have an advantage over the aggressor. Help in money, weapons and people who are ready to fight is coming from all sides, and you just need to withstand the initial blow, in ten days you will surely be even stronger to resist the enemy and go on the counter-offensive».</p>
<p>Friend! You are absolutely right, in fact, the ratio is even better, for 1 killed Ukrainian, 11-12 killed Orcs, and then, because of the death of civilians from bombing and missile strikes!</p> 
<p>"original message"<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg59396947#msg59396947">CLICK</a>.</p>
<p>The war came to Ukraine on February 24. Copying the actions of Hitler in 1941, Putin launched a full-scale invasion.</p>
<p>Since then, every day our soldiers, civilians: children, women and the elderly are dying.</p>
<p>Of course, Russia started the war to destroy Ukraine and everything Ukrainian.</p>
<p>The aggressor country is trying to make us "younger brothers" again and impose its own totalitarian regime. However, she fails!</p>
<p>The general, military situation remains difficult!</p> 
<p>There is still a tough battle ahead, but let's stay calm, stick together and support the Ukrainian people in their mortal struggle against our common enemy.
<p>The people of Ukraine heroically fight back and say: "Русский корабль – Иди на хуй".</p>
<p>Just look at a few photo chronicles of this terrible war and try to imagine all this horror in reality, although I think that this is hardly possible without experiencing it personally! God save you from such trials!</p>
<p>Although our army is holding on courageously and has launched a counterattack in some sectors of the front, Ukraine needs help!</p>
<p>Some towns and villages already lack food, medicine, water, communications and electricity.</p>
<p>In this regard, returning to the original post, I want to say!</p>
<p>Based on experience, I can say that to help your city, you do not need a special skill in managing a charitable foundation, but you need the desire of good people to help other good people who are in terrible trouble!</p>
<p>Thank God! There are many merciful people in the world doing charitable deeds!</p>
<p>Caring people of the Planet want to support Ukrainians!</p>
<p>These wonderful people simply need to be told how they can help Ukrainians!</p>
<p>Kind people who do not stay away from the war support Ukrainians and encourage other merciful people on social networks to do the same!</p>
<p>People know that civilians in Ukraine are shot, shelled, bombed, their houses are on fire, they and their children bleed!</p>
<p>People provide help at the behest of the Heart, expressing sympathy for the Ukrainians, without demanding anything in return!</p>
<p>Therefore, I was somewhat confused by the meaning of the quote from the original post, in which the author wrote: "I immediately want to say that I will not keep a spreadsheet, all I can do is publish here in the thread photos of the work done and checks, if any"</p>
<p>In the practice of donations known to me, no one asked to publish any tables, photographs of the work done or receipts as a report on the use of donations!</p>
<p>As for the publication of photos of the work done, in the conditions of war, the publication of such information in open sources is prohibited!</p>

<p>I have been in the crypto community since 2013, like most Ukrainian crypto enthusiasts, I do not want to stay away from the grief of my people!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my personal savings were enough for just a few days, but I do not regret them!</p> 
<p>Why do I need a crypto currency if there will be no homeland and Freedom?</p>
<p>Bitcointalk is a platform for communication between crypto enthusiasts from all over the World, so I will not describe to the respected public of a specialized Internet resource all the advantages of cryptocurrencies over fiat payments.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is not a replacement for traditional donations, but an additional fundraising tool, the advantage of which in wartime is an obvious fact.</p>
<p>Compared to bank transfers, this is quick and easy.</p> 
<p>Ukrainians saw cryptocurrencies as an alternative to public and private financial institutions, which are not trusted in wartime due to the threat of losing funds.</p>
<p>Even if the banking system fails, people know how to convert crypto currency into cash and vice versa.</p>
<p>So thanks to the crypt it will be possible to buy everything you need during the War.</p>
<p>Evacuated Ukrainians can transfer funds to crypto, so that later they can safely convert back to any fiat currency already abroad, without the risk of losing significant amounts due to depreciation.</p>
<p>For foundations that collect donations for the army, raising cryptocurrencies is reliable than fiat money, as some financial institutions equate such activities with “supporting violence.”</p>
<p>For example, on the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, February 24, fundraising platform Ptatreon removed the Turn Back Alive fund page, explaining that it “does not allow funds raised on the platform to be used to support violence or purchase military technique".</p>
<p>For those crypto enthusiasts who are ready to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I will leave here a few links to official funds through which you can send donations in crypto currency from anywhere in the world.</p>
<h3>Here are a few official, state funds of Ukraine collecting cryptocurrency:</h3>
    <h3>Turn Back Alive"</h3> 
    <p>"VIEW"<a href="https://www.comebackalive.in.ua/uk/donate">CLICK</a>.</p>
    <h3>"Reserve fund of Ukraine"</h3> 
    <p>"VIEW"<a href="https://my.kuna.io/en/kunaid-ukraine">CLICK</a>.</p>
    <h3>"Ministry and Committee of Digital Transformation of Ukraine"</h3> 
    <p>"VIEW"<a href="https://donate.thedigital.gov.ua">CLICK</a>.</p>

    <h3>"Voices"</h3>

    <h3>"Cyberpolice of Ukraine"</h3> 
    <p>"VIEW"<a href="https://t.me/CyberpolUA/1069">CLICK</a>.</p>
<p>The crypto-currency collected by private funds is connected to the conversion processes on the FTX and KUNA exchanges.</p>
<p>The exchange converts cryptocurrency into fiat, dollar or hryvnia and sends it to the account of the Ministry of Digital Development or the Economy of the Bank of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people in the World doubt the effectiveness of their help because of the negative image of corrupt officials in Ukraine!</p>
<p>In support of the above, here is a quote from original post: "I am sure that the Ukrainian government is corrupt and oppressed many people within its borders for various reasons, by the way, so I would not donate to their official BTC addresses or anything"</p> 
<p>"original link"<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382794.msg59474469#msg59474469">CLICK</a>.</p>
<p>The total corruption of pre-war Ukrainian officials, I will not deny! How it will be after the war, time will tell, but I hope that corruption will be eradicated forever!</p> 
<p>I know that it is precisely because of the corruption of officials that many people prefer to provide charitable assistance not through official state funds, but through people's volunteers, relatives or caring people in the field, and every day there are more and more active people!</p>
<p>People want to help a particular city, region, community, family, or even an individual.</p>
<p>Regarding existing concerns about massive fundraising scams by various organizations and individual volunteers!</p>
<p>I will say this: There is a war going on in Ukraine and against the general background of charitable donations, the "risk" is negligible.</p>
<p>Fraudulent fees - in terrible time for the people, very isolated phenomena that do not have a significant impact on the desire of kind people to help needy people!</p>
<p>After all, most normal people of the World understand that even their little help can save someone a big life!</p>
<p>At a minimum, doing good deeds, people add a huge plus to their Karma!</p>
<p>In other words, our deeds ripen according to the principle “what we sow, we will reap”!</p>
<p>Good deeds will return good, bad deeds will return evil!</p>
<p>I think who wants to help will help, and who does not want to always find a reason to refuse!</p>
<p>Dear friends!</p>
<p>I don't want to be misunderstood!</p> 
<p>Therefore, I want to clarify that I do not insist, but only urge you to respond to my request and support the Ukrainians with donations, in an amount that will not cause tangible damage to your personal well-being!</p>
<p>Of course, to help or not to help is the personal choice of each person!</p>
<p>I will not write here something like "God is your judge"!</p>
<p>But if the Ukrainian people do not hold back the Russian troops, the Kremlin will not stop at Ukraine alone!</p>
<p>Therefore, I will say a very obvious prospect that if today you are on the sidelines of the war in Ukraine, then do not be surprised if tomorrow you see Putin's troops at the gates of your house!</p>
<p>This has happened more than once in the history of mankind!</p>
<p>Ukraine did not believe that Russia would attack, but the treacherous attack happened!</p>
<p>Continuing the topic of Russian aggression against Ukraine, I would like to answer franky1's question about supporting Ukrainians:
<p>"original link"<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg59390760#msg59390760">CLICK</a>.</p>
<p>Dear Franky1, you asked (I quote): “Are there any local delivery businesses in areas where bitcoin is accepted? And I mean legitimate businesses (not fake phishing sites created last month) through which people can just buy things on a website where you can host some legitimate shelters/clearing points, physical addresses of hospitals (legitimate charities) etc. and use the delivery address of the shelter/hospital as the destination of the goods so that they can then be delivered directly to the shelters/hospitals.</p>
<p>Franky1, about the "non-fake phishing sites created last month" I will say this: talk about phishing risks may have been relevant in peacetime for discussions over a cup of coffee, under blue skies without bombs!</p> 
<p>But for the overwhelming majority of the population of a country at war with the occupier, a scam unacceptable in principle!</p>
<p>In war, there are other criteria of truth!</p>
<p>Of course, today, tomorrow and every new day, new fundraising sites will appear and this is a good trend to achieve Victory and Peace!</p>
<p>Simply put, just because a site has been recently registered doesn't mean it's a phishing fundraiser!</p>
<p>For information, here is one of the new https://needsupport.com.ua/ and it is the same honest site as hundreds of other large, medium and small wartime funds.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the emergence of new donation sites means that more and more good people want to help other good people!</p>
<p>Franky1! Thank you and those who help Ukrainians in the fight for Freedom!</p>
<p>It does not matter to whom, how, with what and to what extent you will help the Ukrainians! Any of your help is priceless and will be accepted by the people of Ukraine with gratitude!</p>
<p>Frankie1, if your concerns about fraudulent fees are the only obstacle to helping Ukrainians, I will try to tell you and other caring people with similar doubts how you can support my compatriots directly!</p>
<p>So, here is my “step by step” life hack for those who want to help Ukrainians, but do not trust corrupt officials, volunteer organizations, civil resistance groups or even ordinary positive people who provide targeted assistance on the ground!</p>
<p>Frankie1, there are a lot of people in Ukraine who need help right now, but try to focus your help on those who need it especially urgently (for example, medicines life support)!</p>
<p>You also need to correctly assess the real situation in order to be able to effectively provide your assistance, which is not easy without knowledge of rear logistics and other opportunities in a particular region.</p>
<p>In besieged cities, destroyed and captured by Russian troops, the chances of providing targeted assistance are minimal, but you need to try!</p>
<p>In places of humanitarian disasters, I recommend providing support by cooperating with official government organizations (they have more logistical, informational, military and other capabilities).</p>
<p>Frankie1, I believe that you will learn how to effectively save people without being directly in Ukraine!</p>
<p>So, Option Basic Step-By-Step!</p>
<p>1. Register an account on the Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange (you can use Binance, but there are fewer payment options in hryvnia)</p>
<p>"original link"<a href="https://kuna.io">CLICK</a>.</p>
<p>2. Fund the exchange account with cryptocurrency (any one from the list of the exchange).</p>
<p>3. Exchange your crypto coins for hryvnia!</p>
<p>4. Find a city, a community and choose the people you want to help, or offer your help yourself.</p>
<p>For example, with the help of a telegram bot, you can easily find both volunteers at your request and offer your help.</p>
<p>"for example here"<a href="https://t.me/saveua_bot">CLICK</a>.</p>
<p>"for example here" <a href="https://ukrainenews.fakty.ua/ru/397671-tem-kto-nuzhdaetsya-v-pomocshi-adresa-volonterskih-telegramm-kanalov"">CLICK</a>.</p>
<p>"for example here"<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/YWL1i8NGX5NhM2My"">CLICK</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the city of Zaporozhye is now a humanitarian hub and a place for receiving refugees from all over the east and south of Ukraine, and in particular the long-suffering residents of Mariupol.</p>
<p>Let's simulate a typical situation: A person needs medicines, but he is limited in money to buy a medicine or the amount he needs (the for example).</p>
<p>Ask this person: price, quantity, where you can buy the right medicine next to him and what payment methods are available (KUNA crypto exchange has 4 payment options in hryvnias + crypto, which is officially allowed in Ukraine).</p>
<p>5. Pay for the medicine and tell the Order number to the person!</p>
<p>Everything! You My Hero!</p>
<p>Here is another option, although less transparent, but easier to implement and quite effective. Step by step!</p>
<p>1. Find a social media chat group in a certain city and select the people you want to help or say you want to help someone.</p>
<p>2. Ask the needy person how much money he needs and for what exactly (better focus on critical positions for life, but this is not necessary).</p>
<p>3. Inform the person that you can donate the equivalent of the amount in cryptocurrency and for this you need to know his crypto wallet (agree the name coin and wallet).</p>
<p>4. Transfer the coins to the person's wallet.</p> 
<p>The person himself will find where to exchange coins and buy what he needs! (via: stock exchange, bank, private exchanger)!</p>
<p>Everything! You My Hero!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when implementing the second option, a problem often arises if a person does not have a crypto wallet and does not know how to use it! He needs the help of a knowledgeable person!</p>
<p>And if a person does not understand the topic of crypto, then there are simply no such people in his environment!</p>
<p>By the way, you can create your own charitable mini-fund and collect donations for Ukrainians from your relatives, friends, acquaintances and local urban communities.</p>
<p>In this case, here are some tips: for each group in a social network (Instagram, Facebook, Reedit, Twitter, LinkedIn and others), create separate crypto wallets!</p>
<p>Then you will know how many compassionate people there are in this or that community!</p>
<p>If the response of the community to your request for help is low, draw the appropriate conclusion!</p>
<p>Do not waste time and the fire of your Soul on people without compassion!</p>
<p>Conversely, with positive people you will do a lot of good deeds!</p>
<p>Important recommendation: If you want to provide only one-time assistance, then it is better, easier, more reliable and more efficient to provide your assistance through official state funds, volunteer organizations or local activists in Ukraine!</p>
<p>So, Franky1, if you want to help Ukrainians on your own, you have my instructions!</p>
<p>If you want to help Ukrainians through the official state fund, you have my links to them!</p>
<p>Also, without a doubt, you can support Ukrainians through my crypto wallets!</p>
<p>To do this, simply send the amount of your donation to any of the following cryptocurrency wallets using the QR-code corresponding to the cryptocurrency:</p>
