  <h1>Ukraine-russia, - Patriotic liberation war in the centre of Europe or the beginning of the Third World War?<br>  
      Hi, now in my country Ukraine is  war! People die heroically defending the ideals of the Free World!</h1>
      <p>There is an air raid again in my city and a siren is buzzing!<br> 
      Civilians are sitting in the basement of the house!<br> 
      It's cold in the basement, people are terrified, and time flows slowly, it seems that it has stopped!<br>  
      I want to write my cry of the soul in continuation of this post on bitcointalk.org <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg59390061#msg59390061">CLICK</a>.</p> <br> 
      Dear friends, crypto enthusiasts, unfortunately, now is a bad time to discuss crypto coins, so I, like other adequate people, write on bitcointalk about the war in Ukraine, my native country, which I love very much!<br>  
      I know that  Ukraine will win and be a free country!<br>  
      Regarding the above post, I want to say: Based on experience, I can say that you do not need special skill in managing a charitable foundation to help your city, but need the desire of some people to help other people who are in terrible trouble!<br> 
      Thank God!<br> 
      There are many merciful people in the World doing God's pleasing deeds!<br>  
      Not indifferent people of the planet, want to save the lives of Ukrainian people!<br>  
      One only needs to say to these wonderful people how they can help the Ukrainians!<br>  
      Good people, not standing aside from the war, donate their funds and call through social networks to donate to the Ukrainians!<br>  
      People know that civilians in Ukraine are being shot, shelled, bombed, their houses are on fire, they and their children are bleeding!<br>   
      Those people who themselves donate funds do not ask to publish reports, photos of the work done or checks!<br>  
      People provide help at the behest of their Heart, expressing their sympathy for the Ukrainians, do not demand anything in return!<br>  
      Here are a few official, state funds of Ukraine collecting help with cryptocurrency:  
      "Come Back Alive" <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://www.comebackalive.in.ua/uk/donate">CLICK</a>.</p><br> 
      "Reserve fund of Ukraine" <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://my.kuna.io/en/kunaid-ukraine">CLICK</a>.</p><br> 
      "Ministry and Committee forDigital Transformation of Ukraine" <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://thedigital.gov.ua/news/ofitsiyni-kriptogamantsi-kudi-mozhna-perekazati-groshi-dlya-armii-ukraini">CLICK</a>.</p><br> 
      "Razom" <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://razomforukraine.org/donate">LINCK</a>.</p><br> "Voices" <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://voices.org.ua/en/donat">CLICK</a>.</p><br>  
      "Cyberpolice of Ukraine" <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://t.me/CyberpolUA/1069>CLICK</a>.</p><br>   
      The collected cryptocurrency by the State Funds is connected to the conversion process of the FTX and KUNA exchanges.<br>  
      The exchange converts crypto currency into fiat, dollar or UAH and sends it to the accounts of the Ministry of Digital Development or the National Bank of Ukraine.<br>  
      However, many people in the World, doubting the effectiveness of their help, because of the negative image of corrupt officials in Ukraine!<br>  
      Therefore, many people prefer to provide charitable assistance not to large, impersonal, official state funds, but through ordinary people (people's volunteers, relatives or ordinary caring people on the ground)!<br>  
      People want to help a particular city/region or even individually: a person, a family, a community.<br>  
      In support of the above, here is a quote: I am sure that the Ukrainian government is corrupt and oppressed many people within its borders for various reasons, by the way, 
      so I would not donate to their official BTC addresses or anything like that post <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382794.msg59474469#msg59474469">CLICK</a>.</p><br> 
      Concerning the fears spread by about massive fundraising scams!<br>  In the war, fraud is rare!<br> 
      I will say this: against the general background of volunteers and good people they do not have a significant impact on the desire of good people to help other good people!<br>  
      Most people who help are very reasonable! Comparing the risks between fraudulent fundraising and saving people's lives, people unambiguously choose to help Ukrainians!<br>  
      After all, even a little help can save someone a big life!<br>  
      At a minimum, doing good deeds, people put a huge plus on their Karma! In other words, our deeds ripen according to the principle “what we sow, we will reap” 
      good deeds will respond with good, evil ones will turn into evil! I think this:<br>  
      Who wants to help he will help, and who does not want will find a reason to refuse!<br>  
      I am 60 years old, in 1986, I saw the evil face of Atomic Chernobyl and I dare to say that even more Evil has come to Ukraine!<br>

      the power of Airborne Vacuum Bombs and rockets is terrifying even if you are just a spectator, these just those moments in life when you want to be away from all this.<br>  
      And here is what the author of another post wrote: Imagine that one day you wake up and see that your house came under artillery fire, 5 members of your family were killed, 
      you were forced to become refugees, not knowing if you would ever return to the country, which they have called home all their lives.<br>

      I warn you it's impossible to watch without tears! Destroyed houses, shelling of the hospital and maternity hospital, crying mothers!<br>

      wrote: I survived a bloody war and I know perfectly well what it means when grenades and air bombs fall around, and you every for a moment you wonder if it will hit you too.<br>  
      Your country is now in the same situation as mine was in 1991, when Serbian executioners set out to demolish and kill everything in front of them, sparing neither small children nor pregnant women.<br>  
      In Ukraine, the Patriotic War is going on and it is fighting not only for itself, but for the entire civilized World!<br>  
      Dear friends, if I did not convince the need to help the Ukrainians, at least in an amount that would not cause tangible damage to your personal well-being, then further convictions lose their meaning!<br> 
      As they say: God is your Judge! But if today you stand aside from grief in Ukraine, then do not be surprised if tomorrow you see the enemy at your gates!<br>  
      I want to reply to the author of the post <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg59390760#msg59390760">CLICK</a>.</p><br>   
      Dear franky1! You asked if there are any local businesses that deliver in an area that accepts bitcoin.<br>  
      And I mean legitimate businesses. (not fake phishing sites created last month) through which people can just buy things on a website where you can host some legitimate shelters/clearing points, physical addresses of hospitals (legitimate charities), etc. and use the delivery address of the shelter / hospital as the destination of the goods, so that they can then be delivered directly to the shelters / hospitals.  
      Dear franky1! As for "non-fake phishing sites created last month" 
      I will say this: Phishing was relevant for peacetime and reasoning over a cup of coffee under a sky without bombs!<br>  
      In war, other criteria of truth work!<br>  
      Ukraine did not believe that russia would attack, but the treacherous attack happened! Of course there are new sites for collecting donations!<br>  
      They will appear: yesterday, today, tomorrow and every new day, and this is good for Ukrainians and Victory of the whole Friendly World!<br>  
      This does not mean at all that these sites are phishing!<br> 
      It rather means that more good people want to help other good people! What are the benefits of cryptocurrencies for donations?<br> 
      Cryptocurrency is not a replacement for traditional donations “it’s an additional fundraising tool”.<br>  
      For volunteers who collect donations for the army, this is important, because some financial organizations equate their activities with "support for violence."<br>  
      For example, on the first day of russia’s invasion of Ukraine, February 24, fundraising platform Ptatreon removed the page of the Turn Back Alive foundation, explaining that it “does not allow the funds raised on the platform to be used to support violence or purchase military equipment.”<br>  
      Compared to bank transfers, it has several advantages: It's fast and easy. Organizations do not need to spend time opening a bank account and verifying; transfers are made almost instantly, unlike SWIFT transactions, which can take several days. According to Mr. Chobanyan (owner of the Ukrainian exchange KUNA), even if the banking system goes out, people know how to convert cryptocurrency into cash and vice versa. So, thanks to the crypt, it will be possible to buy everything you need during the War.<br>  
      Ukrainians saw cryptocurrency as an alternative to public and private financial institutions, which are not trusted in wartime due to the threat of losing funds.<br>  
      Evacuated Ukrainians can transfer funds to crypto, so that later they can safely convert it back to fiat currency already abroad, not risking losing significant mounts due to a depreciation <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://focus.ua/digital/508137-kak-kriptovalyuty-pomogayut-ukraine-i-rossii-vo-vremya-voyny-mneniya-ekspertov">CLICK</a>.</p><br>  
      Dear "Franky1", I understand your concerns and will try to tell you how you and other merciful people can help Ukrainians, my compatriots!<br>  
      Franky1 thank you and those who help Ukrainians in fight for Freedom!<br>  
      My "step by step" life hack for people who want to help Ukrainians, but do not trust corrupt officials, volunteers and just caring people in Ukraine: 
      You must learn to choose people who need help immediately (for example medicines)!<br>  
      Also, you need to learn military logistics so that effectively provide assistance! Of course, without knowing the local, military situation, technical and logistical capabilities, this is not easy! 
      I mustwarn you that in cities that are under siege, destroyed or captured, the chances are minimal, but you have to try (you will learn from correspondence with a person).<br>  
      Therefore, I initially recommended starting to cooperate with state funds, and in case of distrust, with local volunteers or with caring people on the ground!<br>  
      But, I believe that you yourself will learn how to effectively save people without being directly in Ukraine! Here is my "step by step" life hack for people who want to help Ukrainians, but do not trust corrupt officials, volunteers and just caring people in Ukraine:<br> 
      Option Basic Step By Step:<br>  
       1. Register your account on the Ukrainian crypto currency exchange <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://kuna.io">CLICK</a>.</p> (you can use Binance, but there are fewer payment options in UAH)<br>  
       2. Replenish your exchange account with cryptocurrencies (any from the list of the exchange).<br>  
       3. Exchange your crypto coins for UAH!<br>  
       4. Find a city, a community and select the people you want to help or offer your help.<br>  
          For example here <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://ukrainenews.fakty.ua/ru/397671-tem-kto-nuzhdaetsya-v-pomocshi-adresa-volonterskih-telegramm-kanalov">CLICK</a>.</p>
          + example this <p>"LINK TO VIEW"<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/YWL1i8NGX5NhM2My">CLICK</a>.</p>  
          Example: a person needs medicament, but he was left without money and his house. 
          Find out from this person: price, quantity, website of the nearest working pharmacy that has medicine and payment methods are available (there are 4 options in UAH + crypto). Cryptocurrencies are allowed in Ukraine.<br>  
       5. Pay for the medicine and tell the Order number to the person! Everything! You My Hero!<br> <br> 
       Light option Step-By-Step:<br> 
       1. Find a chat group in social networks of a particular city and select the people you want to help or tell them that you want to help.<br>  
       2. Ask a person how much money he needs and for what exactly (better focus on critical positions for life, but this is not necessary)!<br>  
       3. Tell the person that you can donate the equivalent of the amount in cryptocurrency, but you need his crypto wallet (agree on the name of the coin).<br>  
       4. After, transfer coins to the person!<br> 
      The person himself will find where to exchange and buy what he needs! (via: stock exchange, bank, private exchanger)!<br>  Everything! You my hero!<br>   
      Unfortunately there is one problem! Very often, people in need do not have a crypto account and do not know how to make it and how it works!<br>  
      Need to explain and teach! Otherwise, they have to turn to outside help for help!<br> 
      And if you are not in the crypto topic, then there are simply no such people in your environment!<br> 
      Therefore, it is better, easier, more reliable and more efficient to provide assistance through: official state funds, volunteer organizations or people like me!<br>  
      Dear Franky1, you can create your own charitable mini-fund and collect donations for Ukrainians from your relatives, friends, acquaintances and local urban communities.<br> 
      Some recommendations for collecting donations to the mini fund.<br> 
      For each new community (Instagram, Facebook, Reedit, Twitter, LinkedIn and others, it's better to create separate crypto wallets!<br> 
      You can easily find out how many merciful people there are in this social network! <br> 
      If there is low responsiveness to a call for help, make an appropriate conclusion!<br>  
      Do not waste time and the fire of the Soul on people without compassion!<br>  
      And vice versa, with positive people, you will do a lot of good deeds, which will help Ukrainians a lot!<br> 
      Ukrainians will be incredibly grateful to you and all other kind people!<br> 
      Dear Franky1 and other merciful people, if you want to provide only one-time assistance to Ukraine, and not become a permanent international volunteer, then it is better, easier, more reliable and more efficient to provide your assistance through official state funds, volunteers like me!<br> 
      So, Franky1, if you want to help the Ukrainians on your own, you have my instructions!<br> 
      If you want to help through an official state fund of Ukraine, you can use links above in the text!<br>

      then draw the appropriate conclusion and do not waste your time and the fire of the Soul on communicating with people who do not have compassion!

      Ukrainians will be incredibly grateful to you and all kind people!<br>
